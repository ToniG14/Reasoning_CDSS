Hestia exclusion criteria for outpatient management of pulmonary embolism (from Zondag et al. $^{32}$). If the answer to one or more of the questions is 'yes', then the patient cannot be treated at home.

BP = blood pressure; b.p.m. = beats per minute; CrCl = creatinine clearance; i.v. = intravenous; PE = pulmonary embolism.

$^{a}$ Include the following criteria but leave them to the discretion of the investigator: systolic BP <100 mmHg with heart rate >100 b.p.m.; condition requiring admission to an intensive care unit.

$^{b}$ Gastrointestinal bleeding in the preceding 14 days, recent stroke (<4 weeks ago), recent operation (<2 weeks ago), bleeding disorder or thrombocytopenia (platelet count <75 * 10 $^{9}$/L), or uncontrolled hypertension (systolic BP >180 mmHg or diastolic BP >110 mmHg).

Echocardiographic signs suggesting PH used to assess the probability of PH in addition to tricuspid regurgitation velocity measurement. 59 AcT = right ventricular outflow Doppler acceleration time; IVC = inferior vena cava; LV = left ventricular; PA = pulmonary artery; PH = pulmonary hypertension; RA = right atrium; RV = right ventricular.

$^{a}$ Echocardiographic signs from at least two different categories (A/B/C) from the list should be present to alter the echocardiographic probability of PH.

ACS = acute coronary syndrome; CTPA = computed tomography pulmonary angiography; ECG = electrocardiogram; ECMO = extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; IU = international units; i.v. = intravenous; PE = pulmonary embolism; RV = right ventricular. $^{a}$ See Figure 3 and Supplementary Table 3 .
