## 1 Preamble

Guidelines summarize and evaluate available evidence with the aim of assisting health professionals in proposing the best management strategies for an individual patient with a given condition. Guidelines and their recommendations should facilitate decision making of health professionals in their daily practice. However, the final decisions concerning an individual patient must be made by the responsible health professional(s) in consultation with the patient and caregiver as appropriate.

A great number of guidelines have been issued in recent years by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), as well as by other societies and organisations. Because of their impact on clinical practice, quality criteria for the development of guidelines have been established in order to make all decisions transparent to the user. The recommendations for formulating and issuing ESC Guidelines can be found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines-&Education/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Wri ting-ESC-Guidelines). The ESC Guidelines represent the official position of the ESC on a given topic and are regularly updated.

The ESC carries out a number of registries which are essential to assess, diagnostic/therapeutic processes, use of resources and adherence to Guidelines. These registries aim at providing a better understanding of medical practice in Europe and around the world, based on data collected during routine clinical practice.

The guidelines are developed together with derivative educational material addressing the cultural and professional needs for cardiologists and allied professionals. Collecting high-quality observational data, at appropriate time interval following the release of ESC Guidelines, will help evaluate the level of implementation of the Guidelines, checking in priority the key end points defined with the ESC Guidelines and Education Committees and Task Force members in charge.

The Members of this Task Force were selected by the ESC, including representation from its relevant ESC sub-specialty groups, in order to represent professionals involved with the medical care of patients with this pathology. Selected experts in the field undertook a comprehensive review of the published evidence for management of a given condition according to ESC Committee for Practice Guidelines (CPG) policy. A critical evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures was performed, including assessment of the risk - benefit ratio. The level of evidence and the strength of the recommendation of particular management options were weighed and graded according to predefined scales, as outlined in Tables 1 and 2 .

The experts of the writing and reviewing panels provided declaration of interest forms for all relationships that might be perceived as real or potential sources of conflicts of interest. These forms were compiled into one file and can be found on the ESC website (http:// www.escardio.org/guidelines). Any changes in declarations of interest that arise during the writing period were notified to the ESC and updated. The Task Force received its entire financial support from the ESC without any involvement from the healthcare industry.

The ESC CPG supervises and coordinates the preparation of new Guidelines. The Committee is also responsible for the endorsement process of these Guidelines. The ESC Guidelines undergo extensive review by the CPG and external experts. After appropriate revisions the Guidelines are approved by all the experts involved in the Task Force. The finalized document is approved by the CPG for publication in the European Heart Journal. The Guidelines were developed after careful consideration of the scientific and medical knowledge and the evidence available at the time of their dating.

The task of developing ESC Guidelines also includes the creation of educational tools and implementation programmes for the recommendations including condensed pocket guideline versions, summary slides, booklets with essential messages, summary cards for non-specialists and an electronic version for digital applications (smartphones, etc.). These versions are abridged and thus, for more detailed information, the user should always access to the full text version of the Guidelines, which is freely available via the ESC website and hosted on the EHJ website. The National Societies of the ESC are encouraged to endorse, translate and implement all ESC Guidelines. Implementation programmes are needed because it has been shown that the outcome of disease may be favourably influenced by the thorough application of clinical recommendations.

Health professionals are encouraged to take the ESC Guidelines fully into account when exercising their clinical judgment, as well as in the determination and the implementation of preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic medical strategies. However, the ESC Guidelines do not override in any way whatsoever the individual responsibility of health professionals to make appropriate and accurate decisions in considerat i onofe ac hp at i e nt 'sh e alt hc on d i ti o nandi nco ns ul ta ti o nw it ht h at patient or the patient's caregiver where appropriate and/or necessary. It is also the health professional's responsibility to verify the rules and regulations applicable in each country to drugs and devices at the time of prescription.

## 2 Introduction

### 2.1 Why do we need new Guidelines on the diagnosis and management of pulmonary embolism?

This document follows the previous ESC Guidelines focusing on the clinical management of pulmonary embolism (PE), published in 2000, 2008, and 2014. Many recommendations have been retained or their validity has been reinforced; however, new data have extended or

modified our knowledge in respect of the optimal diagnosis, assessment, and treatment of patients with PE. These new aspects have been integrated into previous knowledge to suggest optimal and-whenever possible-objectively validated management strategies for patients with suspected or confirmed PE. To limit the length of the printed text, additional information, tables, figures, and references are available as supplementary data ontheESCwebsite(www.escardio.org).

These Guidelines focus on the diagnosis and management of acute PE in adult patients. For further details specifically related to the diagnosis and management of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), the reader is referred to the joint consensus document of the ESC Working Groups of Aorta and Peripheral Vascular Diseases, and Pulmonary Circulation and Right Ventricular Function. 1

### 2.2 What is new in the 2019 Guidelines?

### 2.2.1 New/revised concepts in 2019

- **Diagnosis**

D-dimer cut-off values adjusted for age or clinical probability can be used as an alternative to the fixed cut-off value.

Updated information is provided on the radiation dosage when using CTPA and a lung scan to diagnose PE ( Table 6 ).

- **Risk assessment**

A clear definition of haemodynamic instability and high-risk PE is provided ( Table 4 ).

Assessment of PE severity and early PE-related risk is recommended, in addition to comorbidity/aggravating conditions and overall death risk.

A clear word of caution that RV dysfunction may be present, and affect early outcomes, in patients at 'low risk' based on clinical risk scores.

- **Treatment in the acute phase**

Thoroughly revised section on haemodynamic and respiratory support for high-risk PE (Section 6.1).

A dedicated management algorithm is proposed for high-risk PE ( Supplementary Figure 1 ).

NOACs are recommended as the first choice for anticoagulation treatment in a patient eligible for NOACs; VKAs are an alternative to NOACs.

The risk-adjusted management algorithm ( Figure 6 ) was revised to take into consideration clinical PE severity, aggravating conditions/ comorbidity, and the presence of RV dysfunction.

- **Chronic treatment after the first 3 months**

Risk factors for VTE recurrence have been classified according to high, intermediate, or low recurrence risk ( Table 11 ).

Potential indications for extended anticoagulation are discussed, including the presence of a minor transient or reversible risk factor for the index PE, any persisting risk factor, or no identifiable risk factor.

Terminology such as 'provoked' vs. 'unprovoked' PE/VTE is no longer supported by the Guidelines, as it is potentially misleading and not helpful for decision-making regarding the duration of anticoagulation.

VTE recurrence scores are presented and discussed in parallel with bleeding scores for patients on anticoagulation treatment (Supplementary Tables 13 and 14 respectively).

A reduced dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban for extended anticoagulation should be considered after the first 6 months of treatment.

- **PE in cancer**

Edoxaban or rivaroxaban should be considered as an alternative to LMWH, with a word of caution for patients with gastrointestinal cancer due to the increased bleeding risk with NOACs.

- **PE in pregnancy**

A dedicated diagnostic algorithm is proposed for suspected PE in pregnancy ( Figure 7 ).

Updated information is provided on radiation absorption related to procedures used for diagnosing PE in pregnancy ( Table 12 ).

- **Long-term sequelae**

An integrated model of patient care after PE is proposed to ensure optimal transition from hospital to community care.

Recommendations on patient care have been extended to the entire spectrum of post-PE symptoms and functional limitation, not only CTEPH.

A new comprehensive algorithm is proposed for patient follow-up after acute PE ( Figure 8 ).

CTEPH = Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension; CTPA = computed tomography pulmonary angiography; LMWH = low-molecular weight heparin; NOAC(s) = non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant(s); PE = pulmonary embolism; RV = right ventricular; VKA(s) = vitamin K antagonist(s); VTE = venous thromboembolism.

## 3 General considerations

### 3.1 Epidemiology

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), clinically presenting as DVT or PE, is globally the third most frequent acute cardiovascular syndrome behind myocardial infarction and stroke. 2 In epidemiological studies, annual incidence rates for PE range from 39 - 115 per 100 000 population; for DVT, incidence rates range from 53 - 162 per 100 000 population. 3,4 Cross-sectional data show that the incidence of VTE is almost eight times higher in individuals aged > \_80 years than in the fifth decade of life. 3 In parallel, longitudinal studies have revealed a rising tendency in annual PE incidence rates 4 - 7 over time. Together with the substantial hospitalassociated, preventable, and indirect annual expenditures for VTE (an estimated total of up to e 8.5 billion in the European Union), 8 these data demonstrate the importance of PE and DVT in ageing populations in Europe and other areas of the world. They further suggest that VTE will increasingly pose a burden on health systems worldwide in the years to come.

PE may cause < \_300 000 deaths per year in the US, ranking high among the causes of cardiovascular mortality. 3 In six European countries with a total population of 454.4 million, more than 370 000 deaths were related to VTE in 2004, as estimated on the basis of an epidemiological model. 9 Of these patients, 34% died suddenly or within a few hours of the acute event, before therapy could be initiated or take effect. Of the other patients, death resulted from acute PE that was diagnosed after death in 59% and only 7% of patients who died early were correctly diagnosed with PE before death.

Time trend analyses in European, Asian, and North American populations suggest that case fatality rates of acute PE may be decreasing. 4 - 7,10,11 Increased use of more effective therapies and interventions, and possibly better adherence to guidelines, 12,13 has most likely exerted a significant positive effect on the prognosis of PE in recent years. However, there is also a tendency towards overdiagnosis of (subsegmental or even non-existent) PE in the modern era, 14 and this might in turn lead to a false drop in case fatality rates by inflating the denominator, i.e. the total number of PE cases.

Figure 1 summarizes the existing data on global trends in PE, highlighting increasing incidence rates in parallel with decreasing case fatality rates over an ~ 15 year period.

In children, studies have reported an annual incidence of VTE of between 53 - 57 per 100 000 among hospitalized patients, 19,20 and between 1.4 - 4.9 per 100 000 in the community overall. 21,22

### 3.2 Predisposing factors

There is an extensive collection of predisposing environmental and genetic factors for VTE; a list of predisposing (risk) factors is shown in Table 3 . VTE is considered to be a consequence of the interaction between patient-related-usually permanent-risk factors and setting-related-usually temporary-risk factors. Since categorization of temporary and permanent risk factors for VTE is important for assessing the risk of recurrence, and consequently for decisionmaking on chronic anticoagulation, it is discussed in more detail in section 8 of these Guidelines.

Major trauma, surgery, lower-limb fractures and joint replacements, and spinal cord injury are strong provoking factors for VTE. 23,24 Cancer is a well-recognized predisposing factor for VTE. The risk of VTE varies with different types of cancer; 25,26 pancreatic cancer, haematological malignancies, lung cancer, gastric cancer, and brain cancer carry the highest risk. 27,28 Moreover, cancer is a strong risk factor for all-cause mortality following an episode of VTE. 29

Oestrogen-containing oral contraceptive agents are associated with an elevated VTE risk, and contraceptive use is the most frequent VTE risk factor in women of reproductive age. More specifically, combined oral contraceptives (containing both an oestrogen and a progestogen) are associated with an approximately two- to six-fold increase in VTE risk over baseline. 32,33 In general, the absolute VTE risk remains low in the majority of the >100 million combined oral contraceptive users worldwide; 34 however, VTE risk factors, including severe inherited thrombophilia (discussed in section 8 ), 35 increase this risk. Third-generation combined oral contraceptives, containing progestogens such as desogestrel or gestodene, are associated with a higher VTE risk than the second-generation combined oral contraceptives, which contain progestogens such as levonorgestrel or norgestrel. 36,37 On the other hand, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices and some progesterone-only pills (used at contraceptive doses) are not associated with a significant increase in VTE risk; 33,38 consequently, and following counselling and full risk assessment, these options are often proposed to women with a personal or strong family history of VTE.

In post-menopausal women who receive hormone replacement therapy, the risk of VTE varies widely depending on the formulation used. 39

Infection is a common trigger for VTE. 23,40,41 Blood transfusion and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are also associated with an increased risk of VTE.

In children, PE is usually associated with DVT and is rarely unprovoked. Serious chronic medical conditions and central venous lines are considered likely triggers of PE.

VTE may be viewed as part of the cardiovascular disease continuum, and common risk factors-such as cigarette smoking, obesity, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus are shared with arterial disease, notably atherosclerosis. However,thismaybeanindirectassociation mediated, at least in part, by the complications of coronary artery disease and, in the case of smoking, cancer. Myocardial infarction and heart failure increase the risk of PE.  Conversely, patients with VTE have an increased risk of subsequent myocardial infarction and stroke, or peripheral arterial embolization.

### 3.3 Pathophysiology and determinants of outcome

Acute PE interferes with both circulation and gas exchange. Right ventricular (RV) failure due to acute pressure overload is considered the primary cause of death in severe PE. Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) increases if >30 - 50% of the total cross-sectional area of the pulmonary arterial bed is occluded by thromboemboli. PE-induced vasoconstriction, mediated by the release of thromboxane A2 and serotonin, contributes to the initial increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) after PE. 58 Anatomical obstruction and hypoxic vasoconstriction in the affected lung area lead to an increase in PVR, and a proportional decrease in arterial compliance.

The abrupt increase in PVR results in RV dilation, which alters the contractile properties of the RV myocardium via the Frank - Starling mechanism. The increase in RV pressure and volume leads to an increase in wall tension and myocyte stretch. The contraction time of the RV is prolonged, while neurohumoral activation leads to inotropic and chronotropic stimulation. Together with systemic vasoconstriction, these compensatory mechanisms increase PAP, improving flow through the obstructed pulmonary vascular bed and thus temporarily stabilizing systemic blood pressure (BP). However, the extent of immediate adaptation is limited, as a nonpreconditioned, thin-walled RV is unable to generate a mean PAP >40 mmHg.

Prolongation of RV contraction time into early diastole in the left ventricle (LV) leads to leftward bowing of the interventricular septum. 60 The desynchronization of the ventricles may be exacerbated by the development of right bundle branch block. As a result, LV filling is impeded in early diastole, and this may lead to a reduction in the cardiac output (CO), and contribute to systemic hypotension and haemodynamic instability.

As described above, excessive neurohumoral activation in PE can be the result of both abnormal RV wall tension and circulatory shock. The finding of massive infiltrates of inflammatory cells in the RV myocardia of patients who died within 48 h of acute PE may be explained by high levels of epinephrine released as a result of the PE-induced 'myocarditis'. 62 This inflammatory response might explain the secondary haemodynamic destabilization that sometimes occurs 24 - 48 h after acute PE, although early recurrence of PE may be an alternative explanation in some of these cases.

Finally, the association between elevated circulating levels of biomarkers of myocardial injury and an adverse early outcome indicates that RV ischaemia is of pathophysiological significance in the acute phase of PE. 63,64 Although RV infarction is uncommon after PE, it is likely that the imbalance between oxygen supply and demand can result in damage to cardiomyocytes, and further reduce contractile forces. Systemic hypotension is a critical element in this process, leading to impairment of the coronary driving pressure to the overloaded RV.

The detrimental effects of acute PE on the RV myocardium and the circulation are summarized in: **Increased RV afterload:** 1. RV dilatation → 2. TV insufficiency → 3. RV wall tension increases → 4. Neurohormonal activation → 5. Myocardial inflammation → 6. RV O₂ demand increases → 7. Intrapulmonary A-V shunting → 8. RV ischaemia, hypoxic injury → 9. RV contractility decreases → 10. RV output decreases → 11. LV preload decreases → 12. CO decreases → 13. Systemic BP decreases → 14. Coronary perfusion of RV decreases → 15. RV O₂ delivery decreases → 16. Obstructive shock → 17. Death

Respiratory failure in PE is predominantly a consequence of haemodynamic disturbances. Low CO results in desaturation of the mixed venous blood. Zones of reduced flow in obstructed pulmonary arteries, combined with zones of overflow in the capillary bed served by non-obstructed pulmonary vessels, result in ventilation/perfusion mismatch, which contributes to hypoxaemia. In about one-third of patients, right-to-left shunting through a patent foramen ovale can be detected by echocardiography; this is caused by an inverted pressure gradient between the right atrium (RA) and left atrium, and may lead to severe hypoxaemia, and an increased risk of paradoxical embolization and stroke. 67 Finally, even if they do not affect haemodynamics, small distal emboli may create areas of alveolar haemorrhage resulting in haemoptysis, pleuritis, and pleural effusion, which is usually mild. This clinical presentation is known as 'pulmonary infarction'. Its effect on gas exchange is normally mild, except in patients with pre-existing cardiorespiratory disease.

|                                        | End-organ hypoperfusion (altered mental status; cold, clammy skin; oliguria/anuria; increased serum lactate) |                                                                                               |

In view of the above pathophysiological considerations, acute RV failure, defined as a rapidly progressive syndrome with systemic congestion resulting from impaired RV filling and/or reduced RV flow output, 68 is a critical determinant of clinical severity and outcome in acute PE. Accordingly, clinical symptoms, and signs of overt RV failure and haemodynamic instability, indicate a high risk of early (in-hospital or 30 day) mortality. High-risk PE is defined by haemodynamic instability and encompasses the forms of clinical presentation shown in Table 4 .

As an immediately life-threatening situation, high-risk PE requires an emergency diagnostic (upon suspicion) and therapeutic (upon confirmation or if the level of suspicion is sufficiently high) strategy, as outlined in section 7 . However, the absence of haemodynamic instability does not exclude beginning (and possibly progressing) RV dysfunction, and thus an elevated PE-related early risk. In this large population, further assessment (outlined in sections 5 and 7 ) is necessary to determine the level of risk and adjust management decisions accordingly.

## 4 Diagnosis

The increased awareness of venous thromboembolic disease and the ever-increasing availability of non-invasive imaging tests, mainly computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography (CTPA), have generated a tendency for clinicians to suspect and initiate a diagnostic workup for PE more frequently than in the past. This changing attitude is illustrated by the rates of PE confirmation among patients undergoing diagnostic workup: these were as low as 5% in recent North American diagnostic studies, in sharp contrast to the approximately 50% prevalence reported back in the early 1980s. Therefore, it is critical that, when evaluating non-invasive diagnostic strategies for PE in the modern era, it is ensured that they are capable of safely excluding PE in contemporary patient populations with a rather low pre-test probability of the disease. Conversely, a positive test should have an adequate specificity to set the indication for anticoagulant treatment.

### 4.1 Clinical presentation

The clinical signs and symptoms of acute PE are non-specific. In most cases, PE is suspected in a patient with dyspnoea, chest pain, presyncope or syncope, or haemoptysis. Haemodynamic instability is a rare but important form of clinical presentation, as it indicates central or extensive PE with severely reduced haemodynamic reserve. Syncope may occur, and is associated with a higher prevalence of haemodynamic instability and RV dysfunction. Conversely, and according to the results of a recent study, acute PE may be a frequent finding in patients presenting with syncope (17%), even in the presence of an alternative explanation.

In some cases, PE may be asymptomatic or discovered incidentally during diagnostic workup for another disease.

Dyspnoea may be acute and severe in central PE; in small peripheral PE, it is often mild and may be transient. In patients with preexisting heart failure or pulmonary disease, worsening dyspnoea may be the only symptom indicative of PE. Chest pain is a frequent symptom of PE and is usually caused by pleural irritation due to distal emboli causing pulmonary infarction. In central PE, chest pain may have a typical angina character, possibly reflecting RV ischaemia, and requiring differential diagnosis from an acute coronary syndrome or aortic dissection.

In addition to symptoms, knowledge of the predisposing factors for VTE is important in determining the clinical probability of the disease, which increases with the number of predisposing factors present; however, in 40% of patients with PE, no predisposing factors are found. Hypoxaemia is frequent, but < \_40% of patients have normal arterial oxygen saturation (SaO_2) and 20% have a normal alveolar - arterial oxygen gradient. Hypocapnia is also often present. A chest X-ray is frequently abnormal and, although its findings are usually non-specific in PE, it may be useful for excluding other causes of dyspnoea or chest pain. 82 Electrocardiographic changes indicative of RV strain-such as inversion of T waves in leads V1 - V4, a QR pattern in V1, a S1Q3T3 pattern, and incomplete or complete right bundle branch block-are usually found in more severe cases of PE; in milder cases, the only abnormality may be sinus tachycardia, present in 40% of patients. Finally, atrial arrhythmias, most frequently atrial fibrillation, may be associated with acute PE.

b.p.m. = beats per minute; DVT = deep vein thrombosis; PE = pulmonary embolism.

### 4.2 Assessment of clinical (pre-test) probability

The combination of symptoms and clinical findings with the presence of predisposing factors for VTE allows the classification of patients with suspected PE into distinct categories of clinical or pre-test probability, which correspond to an increasing actual prevalence of confirmed PE. This pre-test assessment can be done either by implicit (empirical) clinical judgement or by using prediction rules. As the post-test (i.e. after an imaging test) probability of PE depends not only on the characteristics of the diagnostic test itself but also on the pretest probability, this is a key step in all diagnostic algorithms for PE.

The value of empirical clinical judgement has been confirmed in several large series. Clinical judgement usually includes commonplace tests such as chest X-rays and electrocardiograms for differential diagnosis. However, as clinical judgement lacks standardization, several explicit clinical prediction rules have been developed. Of these, the most frequently used prediction rules are the revised Geneva rule ( Table 5 ) and the Wells rule (see Supplementary Data Table 1). Both prediction rules have been simplified in an attempt to increase their adoption into clinical practice; the simplified versions have been externally validated.

Regardless of the score used, the proportion of patients with confirmed PE can be expected to be ~ 10% in the low-probability category, 30% in the moderate-probability category, and 65% in the highprobability category. When the two-level classification is used, the proportion of patients with confirmed PE is ~ 12% in the PE-unlikely category and 30% in the PE-likely category. A direct prospective comparison of these rules confirmed a similar diagnostic performance.

### 4.3 Avoiding overuse of diagnostic tests for pulmonary embolism

Searching for PE in every patient with dyspnoea or chest pain may lead to high costs and complications of unnecessary tests. The Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) were developed for emergency department patients with the purpose of selecting, on clinical grounds, patients whose likelihood of having PE is so low that diagnostic workup should not even be initiated. They comprise eight clinical variables significantly associated with an absence of PE: age < 50 years; pulse < 100 beats per minute; SaO_2 >94%; no unilateral leg swelling; no haemoptysis; no recent trauma or surgery; no history of VTE; and no oral hormone use. The results of a prospective validation study, and those of a randomized non-inferiority management study, 95 suggested safe exclusion of PE in patients with low clinical probability who, in addition, met all criteria of the PERC rule. However, the low overall prevalence of PE in these studies does not support the generalizability of the results.

### 4.4 D-dimer testing

D-dimer levels are elevated in plasma in the presence of acute thrombosis because of simultaneous activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis. The negative predictive value of D-dimer testing is high, and a normal D-dimer level renders acute PE or DVT unlikely. On the other hand, the positive predictive value of elevated D-dimer levels is low and D-dimer testing is not useful for confirmation of PE. D-dimer is also more frequently elevated in patients with cancer, in hospitalized patients, 89,98 in severe infection or inflammatory disease, and during pregnancy. Accordingly, the number of patients in whom D-dimer must be measured to exclude one PE (number needed to test) rises from 3 in the general population of an emergency department to > \_10 in the specific situations listed above.

As a number of D-dimer assays are available, clinicians should become aware of the diagnostic performance of the test used in their own hospital. The quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or ELISA-derived assays have a diagnostic sensitivity of > \_95%, and can be used to exclude PE in patients with either low or intermediate pre-test probability. In the emergency department, a negative ELISA D-dimer can, in combination with clinical probability, exclude the disease without further testing in ~ 30% of patients with suspected PE. Outcome studies have shown that the 3 month thrombo-bolic risk was <1% in patients with low or intermediate clinical probability who were left untreated on the basis of a negative test result. 

### 4.4.1 Age-adjusted D-dimer cut-offs

The specificity of D-dimer in suspected PE decreases steadily with age to ~ 10% in patients >80 years of age. 105 The use of age-adjusted cutoffs may improve the performance of D-dimer testing in the elderly. A multinational prospective management study evaluated a previously validated age-adjusted cut-off (age ~ 10 m g/L, for patients aged >50 years) in a cohort of 3346 patients. 106 Patients with a normal ageadjusted D-dimer value did not undergo CTPA; they were left untreated and followed for a 3 month period. Among the 766 patients who were > \_75 years of age, 673 had a non-high clinical probability. Use of the age-adjusted (instead of the 'standard' 500 m g/L) D-dimer cut-off increased the number of patients in whom PE could be excluded from 6.4 to 30%, without additional false-negative findings. 106

### 4.4.2 D-dimer cut-offs adapted to clinical probability

A prospective management trial used the 'YEARS' clinical decision rule, which consists of three clinical items of the Wells score (see Supplementary Data Table 1 )-namely signs of DVT, haemoptysis, and PE more likely than an alternative diagnosis-plus D-dimer concentrations. 107 PE was considered to be excluded in patients without clinical items and D-dimer levels <1000 ng/mL, or in patients with one or more clinical items and D-dimer levels <500 ng/mL. All other patients underwent CTPA. Of the 2946 patients (85%) in whom PE was ruled out at baseline and who were left untreated, 18 [0.61%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 - 0.96%] were diagnosed with symptomatic VTE during the 3 month follow-up. CTPA was avoided in 48% of the included patients using this algorithm, compared to 34% if the Wells rule and a fixed D-dimer threshold of 500 ng/mL would have been applied. 107

### 4.4.3 Point-of-care D-dimer assays

In certain situations, notably in community or primary care medicine, 'on-the-spot' D-dimer testing may have advantages over referring a patient to a central laboratory for D-dimer testing. This may particularly apply to remote areas where access to healthcare is limited.However, point-of-care assays have a lower sensitivity and negative predictive value compared with laboratory-based D-dimer tests. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, sensitivity of point-ofcare D-dimer assays was 88% (95% CI 83 - 92%) whereas conventional laboratory-based D-dimer testing had a sensitivity of at least 95%. 110 As a result, point-of-care D-dimer assays should only be used in patients with a low pre-test probability. In these situations, PE could be ruled out in 46% of patients with suspected PE without proceeding to imaging tests (with a failure rate of 1.5%), as suggested by a prospective study in Dutch primary care. 111

### 4.5 Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography

Multidetector CTPA is the method of choice for imaging the pulmonary vasculature in patients with suspected PE. It allows adequate visualization of the pulmonary arteries down to the subsegmental level. The Prospective Investigation On Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis (PIOPED) II study observed a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 96% for (mainly four-detector) CTPA in PE diagnosis. 115 PIOPED II also highlighted the influence of pre-test clinical probability on the predictive value of multidetector CTPA. In patients with a low or intermediate clinical probability of PE, a negative CTPA had a high negative predictive value for PE (96 and 89%, respectively), but its negative predictive value was only 60% if the pre-test probability was high. Conversely, the positive predictive value of a positive CTPA was high (92 - 96%) in patients with an intermediate or high clinical probability, but much lower (58%) in patients with a low pre-test likelihood of PE. 115 Therefore, clinicians should consider further testing in case of discordance between clinical judgement and the CTPA result.

Several studies have provided evidence in favour of CTPA as a stand-alone imaging test for excluding PE. Taken together, the available data suggest that a negative CTPA result is an adequate criterion for the exclusion of PE in patients with low or intermediate clinical probability of PE. On the other hand, it remains controversial whether patients with a negative CTPA and a high clinical probability should be further investigated.

Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a potentially fatal late sequela of PE, but pre-existing CTEPH should not be missed in patients investigated for suspected acute PE. Signs of preexisting CTEPH on CTPA are listed in Supplementary Data Table 2 ; the diagnosis and management of CTEPH is discussed in section 10 .

The major strengths, weaknesses/limitations, and radiation issues related to the use of CTPA in the diagnosis of PE are summarized in Table 6 .

$^{a}$ In this section, effective radiation dose is expressed in mSv [dose in mSv = absorbed dose in mGy * radiation weighting factor (1.0 for X-rays) * tissue weighting factor]. This reflects the effective doses of all organs that have been exposed, that is, the overall radiation dose to the body from the imaging test. Compare with Table 12 , in which the absorbed radiation dose is expressed in mGy to reflect the radiation exposure to single organs or to the foetus.

$^{b}$ For comparison, the whole-body effective dose of a chest X-ray examination is 0.1 mSv.141

### 4.6 Lung scintigraphy

The planar ventilation/perfusion [V/Q (lung scintigraphy)] scan is an established diagnostic test for suspected PE. Perfusion scans are combined with ventilation studies, for which multiple tracers such as xenon-133 gas, krypton-81 gas, technetium-99m-labelled aerosols, or technetium-99m-labelled carbon microparticles (Technegas) can be used. The purpose of the ventilation scan is to increase specificity: in acute PE, ventilation is expected to be normal in hypoperfused segments (mismatched). Being a lower-radiation and contrast mediumsparing procedure, the V/Q scan may preferentially be applied in outpatients with a low clinical probability and a normal chest X-ray, in young (particularly female) patients, in pregnant women, in patients

with history of contrast medium-induced anaphylaxis, and patients with severe renal failure.

Planar lung scan results are frequently classified according to the criteria established in the PIOPED study. 117 These criteria were the subject of debate and have been revised. To facilitate communication with clinicians, a three-tier classification is preferable: normal scan (excluding PE), high-probability scan (considered diagnostic of PE in most patients), and non-diagnostic scan. 120 - 122 Prospective clinical outcome studies suggested that it is safe to withhold anticoagulant therapy in patients with a normal perfusion scan. This was con -firm ed by a randomized trial comparing the V/Q scan with CTPA. 122 An analysis from the PIOPED II study suggested that a highprobability V/Q scan could confirm PE, although other sources suggest that the positive predictive value of a high-probability lung scan is not sufficient to confirm PE in patients with a low clinical probability.s

Performing only a perfusion scan might be acceptable in patients with a normal chest X-ray; any perfusion defect in this situation would be considered a mismatch. The high frequency of nondiagnostic scans is a limitation because they indicate the necessity for further diagnostic testing. Various strategies to overcome this problem have been proposed, notably the incorporation of clinical probability. Although the use of perfusion scanning and chest X-ray with the Prospective Investigative Study of Acute Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis (PISAPED) criteria may be associated with a low rate of inconclusive results, the sensitivity appears too low to exclude PE and thus this approach may be less safe than CTPA.

Several studies suggest that data acquisition in single-photon emission CT (SPECT) imaging, with or without low-dose CT, may decrease the proportion of non-diagnostic scans to as low as 0 - 5%. 121,126 - 128 However, most studies reporting on the accuracy of SPECT are limited by their retrospective design 129,130 or the inclusion of SPECT itself in the reference standard, 127 and only one study used a validated diagnostic algorithm. 131 The diagnostic criteria for SPECT also varied; most studies defined PE as one or two subsegmental perfusion defects without ventilation defects, but these criteria are infrequently used in clinical practice. In addition, the optimal scanning technique (perfusion SPECT, V/Q SPECT, perfusion SPECT with non-enhanced CT, or V/Q SPECT with non-enhanced CT) remains to be defined. Finally, few outcome studies are available, and with incomplete follow-up. 132 Large-scale prospective studies are needed to validate SPECT techniques.

The major strengths, weaknesses/limitations, and radiation issues related to the use of V/Q scan and V/Q SPECT in the diagnosis of PE are summarized in Table 6 .

### 4.7 Pulmonary angiography

For several decades, pulmonary angiography was the 'gold standard' for the diagnosis or exclusion of acute PE, but it is now rarely performed as less-invasive CTPA offers similar diagnostic accuracy. 133 The diagnosis of acute PE is based on direct evidence of a thrombus in two projections, either as a filling defect or as amputation of a pulmonary arterial branch. 134 Thrombi as small as 1 - 2mmwithinthesubsegmental arteries can be visualized by digital subtraction angiography, but there is substantial interobserver variability at this level. 135,136

Pulmonary angiography is not free of risk. In a study of 1111 patients, procedure-related mortality was 0.5%, major non-fatal

complications occurred in 1%, and minor complications in 5%. 137 The majority of deaths occurred in patients with haemodynamic compromise or respiratory failure. The amount of contrast agent should be reduced and non-selective injections avoided in patients with haemodynamic compromise. 138

The major strengths, weaknesses/limitations, and radiation issues related to the use of pulmonary angiography in the diagnosis of PE are summarized in Table 6 .

### 4.8 Magnetic resonance angiography

Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has been evaluated for several years regarding suspected PE. However, the results of large-scale studies 139,140 show that this technique, although promising, is not yet ready for clinical practice due to its low sensitivity, the high proportion of inconclusive MRA scans, and its low availability in most emergency settings. The hypothesis that a negative MRA, combined with the absence of proximal DVT on compression ultrasonography (CUS), may safely rule out clinically significant PE is currently being investigated in an ongoing multicentre outcome study [Clinicaltrials.gov National Clinical Trial (NCT) number 02059551].

### 4.9 Echocardiography

Acute PE may lead to RV pressure overload and dysfunction, which can be detected by echocardiography. Given the peculiar geometry of the RV, there is no individual echocardiographic parameter that provides fast and reliable information on RV size or function. This is why echocardiographic criteria for the diagnosis of PE have differed between studies. Because of the reported negative predictive value of 40 - 50%, a negative result cannot exclude PE. 124,142,143 On the other hand, signs of RV overload or dysfunction may also be found in the absence of acute PE, and may be due to concomitant cardiac or respiratory disease.

Echocardiographic findings of RV overload and/or dysfunction are graphically presented in Figure 3 . RV dilation is found in > \_25% of patients with PE on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and is useful for risk stratification of the disease. 145 More specific echocardiographic findings were reported to retain a high positive predictive value for PE even in the presence of pre-existing cardiorespiratory disease. Thus, the combination of a pulmonary ejection acceleration time (measured in the RV outflow tract) <60 ms with a peak systolic tricuspid valve gradient <60 mmHg ('60/60' sign), or with depressed contractility of the RV free wall compared to the 'echocardiographic' RV apex (McConnell sign), is suggestive of PE. 146 However, these findings are present in only ~ 12 and 20% of unselected PE patients, respectively. 145 Detection of echocardiographic signs of RV pressure overload helps to distinguish acute PE from RV free wall hypokinesia or akinesia due to RV infarction, which may mimic the McConnell sign. 147 It should be noted that in ~ 10% of PE patients, echocardiography can show potentially misleading incidental findings such as significant LV systolic dysfunction or valvular heart disease. 145 Decreased tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) may also be present in PE patients. 148,149 Echocardiographic parameters of RV function derived from Doppler tissue imaging and wall strain assessment may also be affected by the presence of acute PE ( Figure 3 ). However, they probably have low sensitivity as stand-alone findings, as they were reported to be normal in haemodynamically stable patients despite the presence of PE.

Echocardiographic examination is not mandatory as part of the routine diagnostic workup in haemodynamically stable patients with suspected PE, 124 although it may be useful in the differential diagnosis of acute dyspnoea. This is in contrast to suspected high-risk PE, in which the absence of echocardiographic signs of RV overload or dysfunction practically excludes PE as the cause of haemodynamic instability. In the latter case, echocardiography may be of further help in the differential diagnosis of the cause of shock, by detecting pericardial tamponade, acute valvular dysfunction, severe global or regional LV dysfunction, aortic dissection, or hypovolaemia. 152 Conversely, in a haemodynamically compromised patient with suspected PE, unequivocal signs of RV pressure overload, especially with more specific echocardiographic findings (60/60 sign, McConnell sign, or rightheart thrombi), justify emergency reperfusion treatment for PE if immediate CT angiography is not feasible in a patient with high clinical probability and no other obvious causes for RV pressure overload.

Mobile right-heart thrombi are detected by TTE or transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE), or by CT angiography, in <4% of unselected patients with PE. 153 - 155 Their prevalence may reach 18% among PE patients in the intensive care setting. 156 Mobile right-heart thrombi essentially confirm the diagnosis of PE and are associated with high early mortality, especially in patients with RV dysfunction.

In some patients with suspected acute PE, echocardiography may detect increased RV wall thickness or tricuspid insufficiency jet velocity beyond values compatible with acute RV pressure overload (>3.8 m/s or a tricuspid valve peak systolic gradient >60 mmHg). In these cases, chronic thromboembolic (or other) pulmonary hypertension (PH) should be included in the differential diagnosis.

### 4.10 Compression ultrasonography

In the majority of cases, PE originates from DVT in a lower limb, and only rarely from upper-limb DVT (mostly following venous catheterization). In a study using venography, DVT was found in 70% of patients with proven PE. 161 Nowadays, lower-limb CUS has largely replaced venography for diagnosing DVT. CUS has a sensitivity >90% and a specificity of ~ 95% for proximal symptomatic DVT. 162,163 CUS shows a DVT in 30 - 50% of patients with PE, 162 - 164 and finding a proximal DVT in patients suspected of having PE is considered sufficient to warrant anticoagulant treatment without further testing. 165 However, patients in whom PE is indirectly confirmed by the presence of a proximal DVT should undergo risk assessment for PE severity and the risk of early death.

In the setting of suspected PE, CUS can be limited to a simple fourpoint examination (bilateral groin and popliteal fossa). The only validated diagnostic criterion for DVT is incomplete compressibility of the vein, which indicates the presence of a clot, whereas flow measurements are unreliable. A positive proximal CUS result has a high positive predictive value for PE. The high diagnostic specificity (96%) along with a low sensitivity (41%) of CUS in this setting was shown by a recent meta-analysis. 165,166 CUS is a useful procedure in the diagnostic strategy of patients with CT contraindications. The probability of a positive proximal CUS in suspected PE is higher in patients with signs and symptoms related to the leg veins than in asymptomatic patients.

In patients admitted to the emergency department with haemodynamic instability and suspicion of PE, a combination of venous ultrasound with cardiac ultrasound may further increase specificity. Conversely, an echocardiogram without signs of RV dysfunction and a normal venous ultrasound excluded PE with a high (96%) negative predictive value in one study. 167

### 4.12 Computed tomography venography

When using CTPA, it is possible to image the deep veins of the legs during the same acquisition. 115 However, this approach has not been widely validated and the added value of venous imaging is limited. 164 Moreover, using CT venography is associated with increased radiation doses. 168

## 5 Assessment of pulmonary embolism severity and the risk of early death

Risk stratification of patients with acute PE is mandatory for determining the appropriate therapeutic management approach. As described in section 3.3 , initial risk stratification is based on clinical symptoms and signs of haemodynamic instability ( Table 4 ), which indicate a high risk of early death. In the large remaining group of patients with PE who present without haemodynamic instability, further (advanced) risk stratification requires the assessment of two sets of prognostic criteria: (i) clinical, imaging, and laboratory indicators of PE severity, mostly related to the presence of RV dysfunction; and (ii) presence of comorbidity and any other aggravating conditions that may adversely affect early prognosis.

### 5.1 Clinical parameters of pulmonary embolism severity

Acute RV failure, defined as a rapidly progressive syndrome with systemic congestion resulting from impaired RV filling and/or reduced RV flow output, 68 is a critical determinant of outcome in acute PE. Tachycardia, low systolic BP, respiratory insufficiency (tachypnoea and/or low SaO_2), and syncope, alone or in combination, have been associated with an unfavourable short-term prognosis in acute PE.

### 5.2 Imaging of right ventricular size and function

### 5.2.1 Echocardiography

Echocardiographic parameters used to stratify the early risk of patients with PE are graphically presented in Figure 3 , and their prognostic values are summarized in Supplementary Data Table 3 .O f these, an RV/LV diameter ratio > \_1.0 and a TAPSE <16 mm are the findings for which an association with unfavourable prognosis has most frequently been reported.

Overall, evidence for RV dysfunction on echocardiography is found in > \_25% of unselected patients with acute PE. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have suggested that RV dysfunction on echocardiography is associated with an elevated risk of short-term mortality in patients who appear haemodynamically stable at presentation, 180,181 but its overall positive predictive value for PE-related death was low (<10%) in a metaanalysis. 180 This weakness is partly related to the fact that echocardiographic parameters have proved difficult to standardize. Nevertheless, echocardiographic assessment of the morphology and function of the RV is widely recognized as a valuable tool for the prognostic assessment of normotensive patients with acute PE in clinical practice.

In addition to RV dysfunction, echocardiography can identify rightto-left shunt through a patent foramen ovale and the presence of right heart thrombi, both of which are associated with increased

mortality in patients with acute PE. A patent foramen ovale also increases the risk of ischaemic stroke due to paradoxical embolism in patients with acute PE and RV dysfunction.

### 5.2.2 Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography

CTPA parameters used to stratify the early risk of patients with PE are summarized in Supplementary Data Table 3 .F o u r -chamber views of the heart by CT angiography can detect RV enlargement (RV end-diastolic diameter and RV/LV ratio measured in the transverse or four-chamber view) as an indicator of RV dysfunction. The prognostic value of an enlarged RV is supported by the results of a prospective multicentre cohort study in 457 patients. 184 In that study, RV enlargement (defined as an RV/LV ratio > \_0.9) was an independent predictor of an adverse inhospital outcome, both in the overall population with PE [hazard ratio (HR) 3.5, 95% CI 1.6 - 7.7] and in haemodynamically stable patients (HR 3.8, 95% CI 1.3 - 10.9). 184 A meta-analysis of 49 studies investigating >13 000 patients with PE confirmed that an increased RV/LV ratio of > \_1.0 on CT was associated with a 2.5fold increased risk for all-cause mortality [odds ratio (OR) 2.5, 95% CI 1.8 - 3.5], and with a five-fold risk for PE-related mortality (OR 5.0, 95% CI 2.7 - 9.2). 185

Mild RV dilation (RV/LV slightly above 0.9) on CT is a frequen tfind ing (>50% of haemodynamically stable PE patients), but it probably has minor prognostic significance. However, increasing RV/ LV diameter ratios are associated with rising prognostic specificity, 187,188 even in patients considered to be at 'low' risk on the basis of clinical criteria. 186 Thus, RV/LV ratios > \_ 1.0 (instead of 0.9) on CT angiography may be more appropriate to indicate poor prognosis.

Apart from RV size and the RV/LV ratio, CT may provide further prognostic information based on volumetric analysis of the heart chambers and assessment of contrast reflux to the inferior vena cava (IVC).

### 5.3 Laboratory biomarkers

### 5.3.1 Markers of myocardial injury

Elevated plasma troponin concentrations on admission may be associated with a worse prognosis in the acute phase of PE. Cardiac troponin I or T elevation are defined as concentrations above the normal limits, and thresholds depend on the assay used; an overview of the cut-off values has been provided by a meta-analysis. 194 Of patients with acute PE, between 30 (using conventional assays) 194,195 and 60% (using highsensitivity assays)have elevated cardiac troponin I or T concentrations. A meta-analysis showed that elevated troponin concentrations were associated with an increased risk of mortality, both in unselected patients (OR 5.2, 95% CI 3.3 - 8.4) and in those who were haemodynamically stable at presentation (OR 5.9, 95% CI 2.7 - 13.0).

On their own, increased circulating levels of cardiac troponins have relatively low specificity and positive predictive value for early mortality in normotensive patients with acute PE. However, when interpreted in combination with clinical and imaging findings, they may improve the identification of an elevated PE-related risk and the further prognostic stratification of such patients (Supplementary Data Table 4 ). At the other end of the severity spectrum, high-sensitivity troponin assays possess a high negative predictive value in the setting of acute PE. 197 For example, in a prospective multicentre cohort of 526 normotensive patients, high-sensitivity troponin T concentrations <14 pg/mL had a negative predictive value of 98% for excluding an adverse in-hospital clinical outcome. 63 Age-adjusted high-sensitivity troponin T cutoff values (> \_14 pg/mL for patients aged <75 years and > \_45 pg/mL for those > \_75 years) may further improve the negative predictive value of this biomarker. 196

Heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP), an early and sensitive marker of myocardial injury, provides prognostic information in acute PE, both in unselected and normotensive patients. In a meta-analysis investigating 1680 patients with PE, H-FABP concentrations > \_6 ng/mL were associated with an adverse short-term outcome (OR 17.7, 95% CI 6.0 - 51.9) and all-cause mortality (OR 32.9, 95% CI 8.8 - 123.2). 202

### 5.3.2 Markers of right ventricular dysfunction

RV pressure overload due to acute PE is associated with increased myocardial stretch, which leads to the release of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal (NT)-proBNP. Thus, the plasma levels of natriuretic peptides reflect the severity of RV dysfunction and haemodynamiccompromiseinacutePE. 203 A meta-analysis found that 51% of 1132 unselected patients with acute PE had elevated BNP or NT-proBNP concentrations on admission; these patients had a 10% risk of early death (95% CI 8.0 - 13%) and a 23% (95% CI 20 - 26%) risk of an adverse clinical outcome. 204

Similar to cardiac troponins (see above), elevated BNP or NTproBNP concentrations possess low specificity and positive predictive value (for early mortality) in normotensive patients with PE, 205 but low levels of BNP or NT-proBNP are capable of excluding an unfavourable early clinical outcome, with high sensitivity and a negative predictive value. 180 In this regard, an NT-proBNP cut-off value <500 pg/mL was used to select patients for home treatment in a multicentre management study. 206 If emphasis is placed on increasing the prognostic specificity for an adverse early outcome, higher cut-off values > \_600 pg/mL might be more appropriate. 207

### 5.3.3 Other laboratory biomarkers

Lactate is a marker of imbalance between tissue oxygen supply and demand, and consequently of severe PE with overt or imminent haemodynamic compromise. Elevated arterial plasma levels > \_2 mmol/L predict PE-related complications, both in unselected and in initially normotensive PE patients.

Elevated serum creatinine levels and a decreased (calculated) glomerular filtration rate are related to 30 day all-cause mortality in acute PE. Elevated neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and cystatin C, both indicating acute kidney injury, are also of prognostic value.

A recent meta-analysis investigating patients with acute PE found that hyponatraemia predicted in-hospital mortality (OR 5.6, 95% CI 3.4 - 9.1).

Vasopressin is released upon endogenous stress, hypotension, and low CO. Its surrogate marker, copeptin, has been reported to be useful for risk stratification of patients with acute PE. In a singlecentre derivation study investigating 268 normotensive PE patients, copeptin levels > \_24 pmol/L were associated with a 5.4-fold (95% CI 1.7 - 17.6) increased risk of an adverse outcome. These results were confirmed in 843 normotensive PE patients prospectively included in three European cohorts.

### 5.4 Combined parameters and scores for assessment of pulmonary embolism severity

In patients who present without haemodynamic instability, individual baseline findings may not suffice to determine and further classify PE severity and PE-related early risk when used as stand-alone parameters. As a result, various combinations of the clinical, imaging, and laboratory parameters described above have been used to build prognostic scores, which permit a (semi)quantitative assessment of early PE-related risk of death. Of these, the Bova 218 - 221 and the HFABP (or high-sensitivity troponin T), Syncope, Tachycardia (FAST) scores 219,222,223 have been validated in cohort studies (see Supplementary Data Table 4 ). However, their implications for patient management remain unclear. To date, only a combination of RV dysfunction on an echocardiogram (or CTPA) with a positive cardiac troponin test has directly been tested as a guide for early therapeutic decisions (anticoagulation plus reperfusion treatment vs. anticoagulation alone) in a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) of PE patients presenting without haemodynamic instability. 224

### 5.5 Integration of aggravating conditions and comorbidity into risk assessment of acute pulmonary embolism

In addition to the clinical, imaging, and laboratory findings, which are directly linked to PE severity and PE-related early death, baseline parameters related to aggravating conditions and comorbidity are necessary to assess a patient's overall mortality risk and early outcome. Of the clinical scores integrating PE severity and comorbidity, the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) ( Table 7 ) is the one that has been most extensively validated to date. The principal strength of the PESI lies in the reliable identification of patients at low risk for 30 day mortality (PESI classes I and II). One randomized trial employed a low PESI as the principal inclusion criterion for home treatment of acute PE. 178

In view of the complexity of the original PESI, which includes differently weighed variables, a simplified version (sPESI; Table 7) has been developed and validated. As with the original version of the PESI, the strength of the sPESI lies in the reliable identification of patients at low risk for 30 day mortality. The prognostic performance of the sPESI has been confirmed in observational cohort studies, although this index has not yet been prospectively used to guide therapeutic management of low-risk PE patients.

The diagnosis of concomitant DVT has been identified as an adverse prognostic factor, being independently associated with death within the first 3 months after acute PE. In a meta-analysis investigating 8859 patients with PE, the presence of concomitant DVT was confirmed as a predictor of 30 day all-cause mortality (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.5 - 2.4), although it did not predict PE-related adverse outcomes at 90 days. Thus, concomitant DVT can be regarded as an indicator of significant comorbidity in acute PE.

### 5.6 Prognostic assessment strategy

The classification of PE severity and the risk of early (in-hospital or 30 day) death is summarized in Table 8 . Risk assessment of acute PE begins upon suspicion of the disease and initiation of the diagnostic workup. At this early stage, it is critical to identify patients with (suspected) high-risk PE. This clinical setting necessitates an emergency diagnostic algorithm ( Figure 4 ) and immediate referral for reperfusion treatment, as explained in section 7 , and displayed in Figure 6 and Supplementary Data Figure 1 . Testing for laboratory biomarkers such as cardiac troponins or natriuretic peptides is not necessary for immediate therapeutic decisions in patients with high-risk PE.

In the absence of haemodynamic instability at presentation, further risk stratification of PE is recommended, as it has implications for early discharge vs. hospitalization or monitoring of the patient (explained in section 7 ). Table 8 provides an overview of the clinical, imaging, and laboratory parameters used to distinguish intermediateand low-risk PE. The PESI is-in its original or simplified form-the most extensively validated and most broadly used clinical score to date, as it integrates baseline indicators of the severity of the acute PE episode with aggravating conditions and the comorbidity of the patient. Overall, a PESI of class I - II or an sPESI of 0 is a reliable predictor of low-risk PE.

In addition to clinical parameters, patients in the intermediate-risk group who display evidence of both RV dysfunction (on echocardiography or CTPA) and elevated cardiac biomarker levels in the circulation (particularly a positive cardiac troponin test) are classified into the intermediate-high-risk category. As will be discussed in more detail in section 7 , close monitoring is recommended in these cases to permit the early detection of haemodynamic decompensation or collapse, and consequently the need for rescue reperfusion therapy. 179 Patients in whom the RV appears normal on echocardiography or CTPA, and/or who have normal cardiac biomarker levels, belong to the intermediate-low-risk category. As an alternative approach, use of further prognostic scores combining clinical, imaging, and laboratory parameters may be considered to semi-quantitatively assess the severity of the PE episode, and distinguish intermediate-high-risk and intermediate-low-risk PE. Supplementary Data Table 4 lists the scores most frequently investigated for this purpose in observational (cohort) studies; however, none of them has been used in RCTs to date.

A recent meta-analysis included 21 cohort studies with a total of 3295 patients with 'low-risk' PE based on a PESI of I - II or an sPESI of 0. 234 Overall, 34% (95% CI 30 - 39%) of them were reported to have signs of RV dysfunction on echocardiography or CTPA. Data on early mortality were provided in seven studies (1597 patients) and revealed an OR of 4.19 (95% CI 1.39 - 12.58) for death from any cause in the presence of RV dysfunction; elevated cardiac troponin levels were associated with a comparable magnitude of risk elevation. 234 Early all-cause mortality rates (1.8% for RV dysfunction and 3.8% for elevated troponin levels) were in the lower range of those previously reported for patients with intermediate-risk PE. 235 Until the clinical implications of such discrepancies are clarified, patients with signs of RV dysfunction or elevated cardiac biomarkers, despite a low PESI or an sPESI of 0, should be classified into the intermediate-low-risk category.

## 6 Treatment in the acute phase

### 6.1 Haemodynamic and respiratory support

### 6.1.1 Oxygen therapy and ventilation

Hypoxaemia is one of the features of severe PE, and is mostly due to the mismatch between ventilation and perfusion. Administration of supplemental oxygen is indicated in patients with PE and SaO_2 <90%. Severe hypoxaemia/respiratory failure that is refractory to conventional oxygen supplementation could be explained by right-to-left shunt through a patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect. 67 Further oxygenation techniques should also be considered, including high-flow oxygen (i.e. a high-flow nasal cannula) 236,237 and mechanical ventilation (non-invasive or invasive) in cases of extreme instability (i.e. cardiac arrest), taking into consideration that correction of hypoxaemia will not be possible without simultaneous pulmonary reperfusion.

Patients with RV failure are frequently hypotensive or are highly susceptible to the development of severe hypotension during induction of anaesthesia, intubation, and positive-pressure ventilation. Consequently, intubation should be performed only if the patient is unable to tolerate or cope with non-invasive ventilation. When feasible, non-invasive ventilation or oxygenation through a high-flow nasal cannula should be preferred; if mechanical ventilation is used, care should be taken to limit its adverse haemodynamic effects. In particular, positive intrathoracic pressure induced by mechanical ventilation may reduce venous return and worsen low CO due to RV failure in patients with high-risk PE; therefore, positive end-expiratory pressure should be applied with caution. Tidal volumes of approximately 6 mL/kg lean body weight should be used in an attempt to keep the end-inspiratory plateau pressure <30 cm H_2_O. If intubation is needed, anaesthetic drugs more prone to cause hypotension should be avoided for induction.

### 6.1.2 Pharmacological treatment of acute right ventricular failure

Acute RV failure with resulting low systemic output is the leading cause of death in patients with high-risk PE. The principles of acute right heart failure management have been reviewed in a statement from the Heart Failure Association and the Working Group on Pulmonary Circulation and Right Ventricular Function of the ESC. 68 An overview of the current treatment options for acute RV failure is provided in Table 9 .

If the central venous pressure is low, modest (< \_500 mL) fluid challenge can be used as it may increase the cardiac index in patients with acute PE. 238 However, volume loading has the potential to overdistend the RV and ultimately cause a reduction in systemic CO. 239 Experimental studies suggest that aggressive volume expansion is of no benefit and may even worsen RV function. 240 Cautious volume loading may be appropriate if low arterial pressure is combined with an absence of elevated filling pressures. Assessment of central venous pressure by ultrasound imaging of the IVC (a small and/or collapsible IVC in the setting of acute high-risk PE indicates low volume status) or, alternatively, by central venous pressure monitoring may help guide volume loading. If signs of elevated central venous pressure are observed, further volume loading should be withheld.

Use of vasopressors is often necessary, in parallel with (or while waiting for) pharmacological, surgical, or interventional reperfusion treatment. Norepinephrine can improve systemic haemodynamics by bringing about an improvement in ventricular systolic interaction and coronary perfusion, without causing a change in PVR. 240 Its use should be limited to patients in cardiogenic shock. Based on the results of a small series, the use of dobutamine may be considered for patients with PE, a low cardiac index, and normal BP; however, raising the cardiac index may aggravate the ventilation/perfusion mismatch by further redistributing flow from (partly) obstructed to unobstructed vessels. 241 Although experimental data suggest that levosimendan may restore RV - pulmonary arterial coupling in acute PE by combining pulmonary vasodilation with an increase in RV contractility, no evidence of clinical benefit is available.

Vasodilators decrease PAP and PVR, but may worsen hypotension and systemic hypoperfusion due to their lack of specificity for the pulmonary vasculature after systemic [intravenous (i.v.)] administration. Although small clinical studies have suggested that inhalation of nitric oxide may improve the haemodynamic status and gas exchange of patients with PE, no evidence for its clinical efficacy or safety is available to date.

### 6.1.3 Mechanical circulatory support and oxygenation

The temporary use of mechanical cardiopulmonary support, mostly with veno - arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), may be helpful in patients with high-risk PE, and circulatory collapse or cardiac arrest. Survival of critically ill patients has been described in a number of case series, 247 - 252 but no RCTs testing the efficacy and safety of these devices in the setting of high-risk PE have been conducted to date. Use of ECMO is associated with a high incidence of complications, even when used for short periods, and the results depend on the experience of the centre as well as patient selection. The increased risk of bleeding related to the need for vascular access should be considered, particularly in patients undergoing thrombolysis. At present, the use of ECMO as a stand-alone technique with anticoagulation is controversial 247,252 and additional therapies, such as surgical embolectomy, have to be considered.

A few cases suggesting good outcomes with use of the Impella V R catheter in patients in shock caused by acute PE have been reported. 253,254

### 6.1.4 Advanced life support in cardiac arrest

Acute PE is part of the differential diagnosis of cardiac arrest with non-shockable rhythm against a background of pulseless electrical activity. In cardiac arrest presumably caused by acute PE, current guidelines for advanced life support should be followed. 255,256 The decision to treat for acute PE must be taken early, when a good outcome is still possible. Thrombolytic therapy should be considered; once a thrombolytic drug is administered, cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be continued for at least 60 - 90 min before terminating resuscitation attempts. 257

### 6.2 Initial anticoagulation

### 6.2.1 Parenteral anticoagulation

In patients with high or intermediate clinical probability of PE (see section 4 ), anticoagulation should be initiated while awaiting the results of diagnostic tests. This is usually done with subcutaneous, weightadjusted low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux (Supplementary Data Table 5 ), or i.v. unfractionated heparin (UFH). Based on pharmacokinetic data (Supplementary Data Table 6 ), 259 an equally rapid anticoagulant effect can also be achieved with a nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), and phase III clinical trials have demonstrated the non-inferior efficacy of a single-oral drug anticoagulation strategy using higher doses of apixaban for 7 days or rivaroxaban for 3 weeks. 259 - 261

LMWH and fondaparinux are preferred over UFH for initial anticoagulation in PE, as they carry a lower risk of inducing major bleeding and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. 262 - 265 Neither LMWH nor fondaparinux need routine monitoring of anti-Xa levels. Use of UFH is nowadays largely restricted to patients with overt haemodynamic instability or imminent haemodynamic decompensation in whom primary reperfusion treatment will be necessary. UFH is also recommended for patients with serious renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CrCl) < \_30 mL/min] or severe obesity. If LMWH is prescribed in patients with CrCl 15 - 30 mL/min, an adapted dosing scheme should be used. The

dosing of UFH is adjusted based on the activated partial thromboplastin time (Supplementary Data Table 7 ). 266

### 6.2.2 Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants

NOACs are small molecules that directly inhibit one activated coagulation factor, which is thrombin for dabigatran and factor Xa for apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban. The characteristics of NOACs used in the treatment of acute PE are summarized in Supplementary Data Table 6 . Owing to their predictable bioavailability and pharmacokinetics, NOACs can be given at fixed doses without routine laboratory monitoring. Compared with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), there are fewer interactions when NOACs are given concomitantly with other drugs. 259 In the phase III VTE trials, the dosages of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban were not reduced in patients with mild - moderate renal dysfunction (CrCl between 30 - 60 mL/min), whereas edoxaban was given at a 30 mg dose in these patients. Patients with CrCl <25 mL/min were excluded from the trials testing apixaban, whereas patients with CrCl <30 mL/min were excluded from those investigating rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran (Supplementary Data Table 8 ).

Phase III trials on the treatment of acute VTE (Supplementary Data Table 8 ), as well as those on extended treatment beyond the first 6 months (see section 8 ), demonstrated the non-inferiority of NOACs compared with the combination of LMWH with VKA for the prevention of symptomatic or lethal VTE recurrence, along with significantly reduced rates of major bleeding. 267 The different drug regimens tested in these trials are displayed in Supplementary Data Table 8 .Ina meta-analysis, the incidence rate of the primary efficacy outcome was 2.0% for NOAC-treated patients and 2.2% for VKA-treated patients [relative risk (RR) 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 - 1.05]. 268 Major bleeding occurred in 1.1% of NOAC-treated patients and 1.7% of VKAtreated patients for an RR of 0.60 (95% CI 0.41 - 0.88). Compared with VKA-treated patients, critical site major bleeding occurred less frequently in NOAC-treated patients (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.23 - 0.62); in particular, there was a significant reduction in intracranial bleeding (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.21 - 0.68) and in fatal bleeding (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.15 - 0.87) with NOACs compared with VKAs. 268

Suggestions for the anticoagulation management of PE in specific clinical situations, for which conclusive evidence is lacking, are presented in Supplementary Data Table 9 .

Practical guidance for clinicians regarding the handling of NOACs and the management of emergency situations related to their use are regularly updated by the European Heart Rhythm Association. 259

### 6.2.3 Vitamin K antagonists

VKAs have been the gold standard in oral anticoagulation for more than 50 years. When VKAs are used, anticoagulation with UFH, LMWH, or fondaparinux should be continued in parallel with the oral anticoagulant for > \_5 days and until the international normalized ratio (INR) value has been 2.0 - 3.0 for 2 consecutive days. Warfarin may be started at a dose of 10 mg in younger (e.g. aged <60 years) otherwise healthy patients and at a dose < \_5 mg in older patients. 269 The daily dose is adjusted according to the INR over the next 5 - 7 days, aiming for an INR level of 2.0 - 3.0. Pharmacogenetic testing may increase the precision of warfarin dosing. 270,271 When used in addition to clinical parameters, pharmacogenetic testing improves

anticoagulation control and may be associated with a reduced risk of bleeding, but does not reduce the risk of thromboembolic events or mortality. 272

The implementation of a structured anticoagulant service (most commonly, anticoagulant clinics) appears to be associated with increased time in the therapeutic range and improved clinical outcome, compared with control of anticoagulation by the general practitioner. 273,274 Finally, in patients who are selected and appropriately trained, self-monitoring of VKA is associated with fewer thromboembolic events and increased time in the therapeutic range compared with usual care. 275

### 6.3 Reperfusion treatment

### 6.3.1 Systemic thrombolysis

Thrombolytic therapy leads to faster improvements in pulmonary obstruction, PAP, and PVR in patients with PE, compared with UFH alone; these improvements are accompanied by a reduction in RV dilation on echocardiography. 276 - 279 The greatest benefit is observed when treatment is initiated within 48 h of symptom onset, but thrombolysis can still be useful in patients who have had symptoms for 6 - 14 days. 280 Unsuccessful thrombolysis, as judged by persistent clinical instability and unchanged RV dysfunction on echocardiography after 36 h, has been reported in 8% of high-risk PE patients. 281

A meta-analysis of thrombolysis trials that included (but were not confined to) patients with high-risk PE, defined mainly as the presence of cardiogenic shock, indicated a significant reduction in the combined outcome of mortality and recurrent PE (Supplementary Data Table 10 ). This was achieved with a 9.9% rate of severe bleeding and a 1.7% rate of intracranial haemorrhage. 282

In normotensive patients with intermediate-risk PE, defined as the presence of RV dysfunction and elevated troponin levels, the impact of thrombolytic treatment was investigated in the Pulmonary Embolism Thrombolysis (PEITHO) trial. Thrombolytic therapy was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of haemodynamic decompensation or collapse, but this was paralleled by an increased risk of severe extracranial and intracranial bleeding. In the PEITHO trial, 30 day death rates were low in both treatment groups, although meta-analyses have suggested a reduction in PErelated and overall mortality of as much as 50 - 60% following thrombolytic treatment in the intermediate-risk category (Supplementary Data Table 10 ).

The approved regimens and doses of thrombolytic agents for PE, as well as the contraindications to this type of treatment, are shown in Table 10 . Accelerated i.v. administration of recombinant tissuetype plasminogen activator (rtPA; 100 mg over 2 h) is preferable to prolonged infusions of first-generation thrombolytic agents (streptokinase and urokinase). Preliminary reports on the efficacy and safety of reduced-dose rtPA 284,285 need confirmation by solid evidence before any recommendations can be made in this regard. UFH may be administered during continuous infusion of alteplase, but should be discontinued during infusion of streptokinase or urokinase. 65 Reteplase, 286 desmoteplase, 287 or tenecteplase 179,278,279 have also been investigated; at present, none of these agents are approved for use in acute PE.

It remains unclear whether early thrombolysis for (intermediateor high-risk) acute PE has an impact on clinical symptoms, functional limitation, or CTEPH at long-term follow-up. A small randomized trial of 83 patients suggested that thrombolysis might improve functional capacity at 3 months compared with anticoagulation alone. In the PEITHO trial, 179 mild persisting symptoms, mainly dyspnoea, were present in 33% of the patients at long-term (at 41.6 ± 15.7 months) clinical follow-up. However, the majority of patients (85% in the tenecteplase arm and 96% in the placebo arm) had a low or intermediate probability-based on the ESC Guidelines definition of persisting or new-onset PH at echocardiographic followup. Consequently, the findings of this study do not support a role for thrombolysis with the aim of preventing long-term sequelae ( section 10 ) after intermediate-risk PE, although they are limited by the fact that clinical follow-up was available for only 62% of the study population.

$^{a}$ This is the accelerated regimen for rtPA in pulmonary embolism; it is not officially approved, but it is sometimes used in extreme haemodynamic instability such as cardiac arrest.

### 6.3.2 Percutaneous catheter-directed treatment

Mechanical reperfusion is based on the insertion of a catheter into the pulmonary arteries via the femoral route. Different types of catheters (summarized in Supplementary Data Table 11 ) are used for mechanical fragmentation, thrombus aspiration, or more commonly a pharmacomechanical approach combining mechanical or ultrasound fragmentation of the thrombus with in situ reduced-dose thrombolysis.

Most knowledge about catheter-based embolectomy is derived from registries and pooled results from case series. The overall procedural success rates (defined as haemodynamic stabilization, correction of hypoxia, and survival to hospital discharge) of percutaneous catheter-based therapies reported in these studies have reached 87%; 292 however, these results may be subject to publication bias. One RCT compared conventional heparin-based treatment and a catheter-based therapy combining ultrasoundbased clot fragmentation with low-dose in situ thrombolysis in 59 patients with intermediate-risk PE. In that study, ultrasoundassisted thrombolysis was associated with a larger decrease in the RV/LV diameter ratio at 24 h, without an increased risk of bleeding. 293 Data from two prospective cohort studies 294,295 and a registry, 296 with a total of 352 patients, support the improvement in RV function, lung perfusion, and PAP in patients with intermediate- or high-risk PE using this technique. Intracranial haemorrhage was rare, although the rate of Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) severe and moderate bleeding complications was 10% in one of these cohorts. 294 These results should be interpreted with caution, considering the relatively small numbers of patients treated, the lack of studies directly comparing catheterdirected with systemic thrombolytic therapy, and the lack of data from RCTs on clinical efficacy outcomes.

### 6.3.3 Surgical embolectomy

SurgicalembolectomyinacutePEis usually carried out with cardiopulmonary bypass, without aortic cross-clamping and cardioplegic cardiac arrest, followed by incision of the two main pulmonary arteries with the removal or suction of fresh clots. Recent reports have indicated favourable surgical results in highrisk PE, with or without cardiac arrest, and in selected cases of intermediate-risk PE. 297 - 300 Among 174 322 patients hospitalized between 1999 and 2013 with a diagnosis of PE in New York state, survival and recurrence rates were compared between patients who underwent thrombolysis ( n = 1854) or surgical embolectomy ( n = 257) as first-line therapy. 297 Overall, there

was no difference between the two types of reperfusion treatment regarding 30 day mortality (15 and 13%, respectively), but thrombolysis was associated with a higher risk of stroke and reintervention at 30 days. No difference was found in terms of 5 year actuarial survival, but thrombolytic therapy was associated with a higher rate of recurrent PE requiring readmission compared with surgery (7.9 vs. 2.8%). However, the two treatments were not randomly allocated in this observational retrospective study, and the patients referred for surgery may have been selected. An analysis of the Society of Thoracic Surgery Database with multicentre data collection, including 214 patients submitted for surgical embolectomy for high- ( n = 38) or intermediate-risk ( n = 176) PE, revealed an in-hospital mortality rate of 12%, with the worst outcome (32%) in the group experiencing pre-operative cardiac arrest. 299

Recent experience appears to support combining ECMO with surgical embolectomy, particularly in patients with high-risk PE with or without the need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Among patients who presented with intermediate-risk PE ( n = 28), high-risk PE without cardiac arrest ( n = 18), and PE with cardiac arrest ( n = 9), the in-hospital and 1 year survival rates were 93 and 91%, respectively. 300

### 6.4 Multidisciplinary pulmonary embolism teams

The concept of multidisciplinary rapid-response teams for the management of 'severe' (high-risk and selected cases of intermediaterisk) PE emerged in the USA, with increasing acceptance by the medical community and implementation in hospitals in Europe and worldwide. Set-up of PE response teams (PERTs) is encouraged, as they address the needs of modern systems-based healthcare. 301 A PERT brings together a team of specialists from different disciplines including, for example, cardiology, pulmonology, haematology, vascular medicine, anaesthesiology/intensive care, cardiothoracic surgery, and (interventional) radiology. The team convenes in real time (face-toface or via web conference) to enhance clinical decision-making. This allows the formulation of a treatment plan and facilitates its immediate implementation. 301 The exact composition and operating mode of a PERT are not fixed, depending on the resources and expertise available in each hospital for the management of acute PE.

### 6.5 Vena cava filters

The aim of vena cava interruption is to mechanically prevent venous clots from reaching the pulmonary circulation. Most devices in current use are inserted percutaneously and can be retrieved after several weeks or months, or left in place over the long-term, if needed. Potential indications include VTE and absolute contraindication to anticoagulant treatment, recurrent PE despite adequate anticoagulation, and primary prophylaxis in patients with a high risk of VTE. Other potential indications for filter placement, including free -floa ting thrombi, have not been confirmed in patients without contraindications to therapeutic anticoagulation.

Only two phase III randomized trials have compared anticoagulation with or without vena cava interruption in patients with proximal DVT, with or without associated PE. 302 - 304 In the Prevention of Recurrent Pulmonary Embolism by Vena Cava Interruption (PREPIC) study, insertion of a permanent vena cava filter was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of recurrent PE and a significant increase in the risk of DVT, without a significant difference in the risk of recurrent VTE or death. 303,304 The PREPIC-2 trial randomized 399 patients with PE and venous thrombosis to receive anticoagulant treatment, with or without a retrievable vena cava filter. In this study, the rate of recurrent VTE was low in both groups and did not differ between groups. 302 A systematic review and meta-analysis of published reports on the efficacy and safety of vena cava filters included 11 studies, with a total of 2055 patients who received a filter vs. 2149 controls. 305 Vena cava filter placement was associated with a 50% decrease in theincidenceofPEandan ~70% increase in the risk of DVT over time. Neither all-cause mortality nor PE-related mortality differed between patients with or without filter placement.

The broad indication for placement of a venous filter in patients with recent (<1 month) proximal DVT and an absolute contraindication to anticoagulant treatment is based mainly on the perceived high risk of recurrent PE in this setting, and the lack of other treatment options.

Complications associated with vena cava filters are common and can be serious. A systematic literature review revealed penetration of the venous wall in 1699 (19%) of 9002 procedures; of these cases, 19% showed adjacent organ involvement and > \_8% were symptomatic. 306 Lethal complications were rare (only two cases), but 5% of the patients required major interventions such as surgical removal of the filter, endovascular stent placement or embolization, endovascular retrieval of the permanent filter, or percutaneous nephrostomy or ureteral stent placement. Further reported complications include filter fracture and/or embolization, and DVT occasionally extending up to the vena cava.

## 7 Integrated risk-adapted diagnosis and management

### 7.1 Diagnostic strategies

Various combinations of clinical assessments, plasma D-dimer measurements, and imaging tests have been proposed and validated for PE diagnosis. These strategies have been tested in patients presenting with suspected PE in the emergency department or during their hospital stay, and more recently in the primary care setting. Withholding of anticoagulation without adherence to evidence-based diagnostic strategies was associated with a significant increase in the number of VTE episodes and sudden cardiac death at 3 month follow-up. The most straightforward diagnostic algorithms for suspected PE-with and without haemodynamic instability-are presented in Figures 4 and 5 , respectively. However, it is recognized that the diagnostic approach for suspected PE may vary, depending on the availability of, and expertise in, specific tests in various hospitals and clinical settings.

**Bedside transthoracic echocardiogram**: Ancillary bedside imaging tests may include:
  - Transoesophageal echocardiography (may detect emboli in the pulmonary artery and its main branches).
  - Bilateral venous compression ultrasonography (may confirm deep vein thrombosis and venous thromboembolism). Evaluating for right ventricle dysfunction (RV/left ventricle diameter ratio >1.0).

In the emergency situation of suspected high-risk pulmonary embolism, this refers mainly to a right ventricle/left ventricle diameter ratio >1.0; the echocardiographic findings of right ventricle dysfunction, and the corresponding cut-off levels, are graphically presented in Figure 3, and their prognostic value summarized in Supplementary Data Table 3.

1. **Assess clinical probability of PE** (Clinical judgement or prediction rule)
- Use clinical judgment or prediction rules:
  - **Three-level scheme**: Low, intermediate, or high clinical probability.
  - **Two-level scheme**: PE unlikely or PE likely.

When using a moderately sensitive assay, D-dimer measurement should be restricted to patients with low clinical probability or a PE-unlikely classification, while highly sensitive assays may also be used in patients with intermediate clinical probability of PE due to a higher sensitivity and negative predictive value. Note that plasma D-dimer measurement is of limited use in suspected PE occurring in hospitalized patients. 

2. **D-dimer test**
- **Low/intermediate clinical probability** or **PE unlikely**:
  - **D-dimer test results**:
    - **Negative**: No treatment required.
    - **Positive**: Perform CTPA.
        - **CTPA results**:
            - **No PE**: No treatment required.
            - **PE confirmed**: Anticoagulation treatment for PE.
- **High clinical probability or PE likely**:
  - Perform CTPA.
  - **CTPA results**:
    - **No PE**:
      - No treatment or investigate further (consider additional imaging tests before withholding PE-specific treatment).
    - **PE confirmed**:
      - Anticoagulation treatment for PE.

The diagnostic strategy for suspected acute PE in pregnancy is discussed in section 9 .

### 7.1.1 Suspected pulmonary embolism with haemodynamic instability

The proposed strategy is shown in Figure 4 . The clinical probability is usually high and the differential diagnosis includes cardiac tamponade, acute coronary syndrome, aortic dissection, acute valvular dysfunction, and hypovolaemia. The most useful initial test in this situation is bedside TTE, which will yield evidence of acute RV dysfunction if acute PE is the cause of the patient's haemodynamic decompensation. In a highly unstable patient, echocardiographic evidence of RV dysfunction is sufficient to prompt immediate reperfusion without further testing. This decision may be strengthened by the (rare) visualization of right heart thrombi. 155,157,321,322 Ancillary bedside imaging tests include TOE, which may allow direct visualization of thrombi in the pulmonary artery and its main branches, especially in patients with RV dysfunction. TOE should be cautiously performed in hypoxaemic patients. Moreover, bedside CUS can detect proximal DVT. As soon as the patient is stabilized using supportive treatment, final confirmation of the diagnosis by CT angiography should be sought.

For unstable patients admitted directly to the catheterization laboratory with suspected acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary angiography may be considered as a diagnostic procedure after the acute coronary syndrome has been excluded, provided that PE is a probable diagnostic alternative and particularly if percutaneous catheterdirected treatment is a therapeutic option.

### 7.1.2 Suspected pulmonary embolism without haemodynamic instability

### 7.1.2.1 Strategy based on computed tomographic pulmonary angiography

The proposed strategy based on CTPA is shown in Figure 5 .Inpatients admitted to the emergency department, measurement of plasma Ddimer is the logical first step following the assessment of clinical probability and allows PE to be ruled out in GLYPH<C24> 30% of outpatients. D-dimer should not be measured in patients with a high clinical probability of PE, owing to a low negative predictive value in this population. 323 It is also less useful in hospitalized patients because the number that needs to be tested to obtain a clinically relevant negative result is high.

In most centres, multidetector CTPA is the second-line test in patients with an elevated D-dimer level and the first-line test in patients with a high clinical probability of PE. CTPA is considered to be diagnostic of PE when it shows a clot at least at the segmental level of the pulmonary arterial tree. False-negative results of CTPA have been reported in patients with a high clinical probability of PE; 115 however, such discrepancies are infrequent and the 3 month thromboembolic risk was low in these patients. 171 Accordingly, both the necessity of performing further tests and the nature of these tests remain controversial in these clinical situations.

### 7.1.2.2 Strategy based on ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy

In hospitals in which V/Q scintigraphy is readily available, it is a valid option for patients with an elevated D-dimer and a contraindication to CTPA. Also, V/Q scintigraphy may be preferred over CTPA to avoid unnecessary radiation, particularly in younger patients and in female patients in whom thoracic CT might raise the lifetime risk of breast cancer. V/Q lung scintigraphy is diagnostic (with either normal- or high-probability findings) in ~ 30 - 50% of emergency ward patients with suspected PE. The proportion of diagnostic V/Q scans is higher in patients with a normal chest X-ray, and this might support the use of a V/Q scan as a first-line imaging test for PE in younger patients, depending on local availability. The number of patients with inconclusive findings may further be reduced by taking into account clinical probability. Thus, patients with a non-diagnostic lung scan and low clinical probability of PE have a low prevalence of confirmed PE, and the negative predictive value of this combination is further increased by the absence of a DVT on lower-limb CUS. If a highprobability lung scan is obtained from a patient with low clinical probability of PE, confirmation by other tests should be considered.

### 7.2 Treatment strategies

### 7.2.1 Emergency treatment of high-risk pulmonary embolism

The algorithm for a risk-adjusted therapeutic approach to acute PE is shown in Figure 6; an emergency management algorithm specifically for patients with suspected acute high-risk PE is proposed in Supplementary Data Figure 1 . Primary reperfusion treatment, in most cases systemic thrombolysis, is the treatment of choice for patients with high-risk PE. Surgical pulmonary embolectomy or percutaneous catheter-directed treatment are alternative reperfusion options in patients with contraindications to thrombolysis, if expertise with either of these methods and theappropriateresourcesareavailableon-site.

Following reperfusion treatment and haemodynamic stabilization, patients recovering from high-risk PE can be switched from

parenteral to oral anticoagulation. As patients belonging to this risk category were excluded from the phase III NOAC trials, the optimal time point for this transition has not been determined by existing evidence but should instead be based on clinical judgement. The specifications concerning the higher initial dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban (for 1 and 3 weeks after PE diagnosis, respectively), or the minimum overall period (5 days) of heparin anticoagulation before switching to dabigatran or edoxaban, must be followed (see Supplementary Data Table 8 for tested and approved regimens).

### 7.2.2 Treatment of intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism

For most cases of acute PE without haemodynamic compromise, parenteral or oral anticoagulation (without reperfusion techniques) is adequate treatment. As shown in Figure 6 , normotensive patients with at least one indicator of elevated PE-related risk, or with aggravating conditions or comorbidity, should be hospitalized. In this group, patients with signs of RV dysfunction on echocardiography or CTPA (graphically presented in Figure 3 ), accompanied by a positive troponin test, should be monitored over the first hours or days due to the risk of early haemodynamic decompensation and circulatory collapse. 179 Routine primary reperfusion treatment, notably full-dose systemic thrombolysis, is not recommended, as the risk of potentially life-threatening bleeding complications appears too high for the expected benefits from this treatment. 179 Rescue thrombolytic therapy or, alternatively, surgical embolectomy or percutaneous catheter-directed treatment should be reserved for patients who develop signs of haemodynamic instability. In the PEITHO trial, the mean time between randomization and death or haemodynamic decompensation was 1.79 ± 1.60 days in the placebo (heparin-only) arm. 179 Therefore, it appears reasonable to leave patients with intermediate-high-risk PE on LMWH anticoagulation over the first 2 - 3 days and ensure that they remain stable before switching to oral anticoagulation. As mentioned in the previous section, the specifications concerning the increased initial dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban, or the minimum overall period of heparin anticoagulation before switching to dabigatran or edoxaban, must be followed.

Suggestions for the anticoagulation and overall management of acute PE in specific clinical situations, for which conclusive evidence is lacking, are presented in Supplementary Data Table 9 .

### 7.2.3 Management of low-risk pulmonary embolism: triage for early discharge and home treatment

As a general rule, early discharge of a patient with acute PE and continuation of anticoagulant treatment at home should be considered if three sets of criteria are fulfilled: (i) the risk of early PE-related death or serious complications is low ( section 5 ); (ii) there is no serious comorbidity or aggravating condition(s) (see section 5 )thatwould mandate hospitalization; and (iii) proper outpatient care and anticoagulant treatment can be provided, considering the patient's (anticipated) compliance, and the possibilities offered by the healthcare system and social infrastructure.

Randomized trials and prospective management cohort studies that investigated the feasibility and safety of early discharge, and home treatment, of PE adhered to these principles, even though slightly different criteria or combinations thereof were used to ensure the above three requirements.

The Hestia exclusion criteria (Supplementary Data Table 12 ) represent a checklist of clinical parameters or questions that can be obtained/answered at the bedside. They integrate aspects of PE severity, comorbidity, and the feasibility of home treatment. If the answer to one or more of the questions is 'yes', then the patient cannot be discharged early. In a single-arm management trial that used these criteria to select candidates for home treatment, the 3 month rate of recurrent VTE was 2.0% (0.8 - 4.3%) in patients with acute PE who were discharged within 24 h. 317 In a subsequent non-inferiority trial that randomized 550 patients to direct discharge based on the Hestia criteria alone vs. additional NT-proBNP testing and discharge if levels were < \_500 pg/mL, the primary outcome (30 day PE- or bleeding-related mortality, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or admission to an intensive care unit) was very low in both arms. The results suggest no incremental value of natriuretic-peptide testing in patients who are eligible for home treatment based on the Hestia criteria, although the study was not powered to exclude this possibility. 318

The PESI and its simplified form, the sPESI ( Table 7 ), also integrate clinical parameters of PE severity and comorbidity to permit assessment of overall 30 day mortality. Compared with the Hestia criteria, the PESI is more standardized, but it contains a less-comprehensive list of aggravating conditions; moreover, the sPESI excludes all patients with cancer from the low-risk category (compare Table 7 with Supplementary Data Table 12 ). The PESI was not primarily developed as a tool to select candidates for home treatment, but it has been used-in combination with additional feasibility criteria-in a trial of 344 patients randomized to inpatient vs. outpatient treatment of PE. 178 One (0.6%) patient in each treatment group died within 90 days. 178

In patients who were included in prospective cohort studies and treated at home, with or without a short hospitalization period, the 3 month rates of thromboembolic recurrence, major bleeding, and death were 1.75, 1.43, and 2.83%, respectively. 327

In summary, the currently available evidence indicates that both the Hestia rule and the PESI or sPESI appear capable of reliably identifying patients who are (i) at low PE-related risk, and (ii) free of serious comorbidity. Consequently, either may be used for clinical triage according to local experience and preference. If a PESI- or sPESIbased approach is chosen, it must be combined with assessment of the feasibility of early discharge and home treatment; this assessment is already integrated into the Hestia criteria.

A more difficult decision related to immediate or early discharge is whether the exclusion of intermediate-risk PE on clinical grounds alone is adequate, or whether the assessment of RV dysfunction or myocardial injury (see section 5 )byanimagingtestora laboratory biomarker is necessary to provide maximal safety for the patient in this 'vulnerable' early period. A systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies suggested that the prognostic sensitivity is increased further when clinical criteria (e.g. PESI or sPESI) are combined with imaging findings, or laboratory biomarker levels. 234 A multicentre prospective management trial tested this hypothesis, investigating the efficacy and safety of early discharge, and ambulatory rivaroxaban treatment, in patients selected by clinical criteria and an absence of RV dysfunction.

Overall, ~ 20% of the screened unselected patients with PE were included. At the predefined interim analysis of 525 patients (50% of the planned population), the 3 month rate of symptomatic or fatal recurrent VTE was 0.6% (one-sided upper 99.6% CI 2.1%), permitting the early rejection of the null hypothesis and termination of the trial. Major bleeding occurred in six (1.2%) of the patients in the safety population. There were no PE-related deaths. 319 In view of the existing evidence-and taking into consideration (i) the catastrophic scenario of early death if a patient with acute PE is falsely judged to be at low risk on clinical grounds alone and discharged 'too early' (as described in a prematurely terminated trial), and (ii) the ease and minimal additional effort of assessing RV size and function at presentation by echocardiography, or on the CTPA performed to diagnose the PE event itself ( section 5 )-it is wise to exclude RV dysfunction and right heart thrombi if immediate or early (within the first 24 - 48 h) discharge of the patient is planned.

## 8 Chronic treatment and prevention of recurrence

The aim of anticoagulation after acute PE is to complete the treatment of the acute episode and prevent recurrence of VTE over the long-term. Current drugs and regimens for the initial phase, and the first months of anticoagulant treatment, are described in section 6.

Most of the randomized studies focusing on long-term anticoagulation for VTE have included patients with DVT, with or without PE; only two randomized studies have specifically focused on patients with PE. The incidence of recurrent VTE does not appear to depend on the clinical manifestation of the first event (i.e. it is similar after PE and after proximal DVT). However, in patients who have had a PE, VTE more frequently recurs as PE, while in patients who have had a DVT, it tends to recur more frequently as DVT. As a consequence, the case fatality rate of recurrent VTE in patients who have previously had a PE is twice as high as that of VTE recurrence after DVT.

Landmark clinical trials have evaluated various durations of anticoagulant treatment with VKAs for VTE. The findings of these studies permit the following conclusions. First, all patients with PE should receive > \_3 months of anticoagulant treatment. Second, after withdrawal of anticoagulant treatment, the risk of recurrence is expected to be similar if anticoagulants are stopped after 3 - 6 months compared with longer treatment periods (e.g. 12 - 24 months). Third, extended oral anticoagulant treatment reduces the risk for recurrent VTE by < \_90%, but this benefit is partially offset by the risk of bleeding.

Oral anticoagulants are highly effective in preventing recurrent VTE during treatment, but they do not eliminate the risk of subsequent recurrence after the discontinuation of treatment. Based on this fact on the one hand, and considering the bleeding risk of anticoagulation treatment on the other, the clinically important question is how to best select candidates for extended or indefinite anticoagulation. Involvement of the patient in the decision-making process is crucial to optimize and maintain treatment adherence.

$^{b}$ The categorization of risk factors for the index VTE event is in line with that proposed by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.338 The present Guidelines avoid terms such as 'provoked', 'unprovoked', or 'idiopathic' VTE.

### 8.1 Assessment of venous thromboembolism recurrence risk

The risk for recurrent VTE after discontinuation of treatment is related to the features of the index PE (or, in the broader sense, VTE) event. A study, which followed patients after a first episode of acute PE, found that the recurrence rate after discontinuation of treatment was ~ 2.5% per year after PE associated with transient risk factors, compared with 4.5% per year after PE occurring in the absence of known cancer, known thrombophilia, or any transient risk factor. 331 Similar observations were made in other prospective studies in patients with DVT. 337 Advancing the concept further, randomized anticoagulation trials over the past 15 years, which have focused on secondary VTE prevention, have classified patients into distinct groups based on their risk of VTE recurrence after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment. In general, these groups are: (i) patients in whom a strong (major) transient or reversible risk factor, most commonly major surgery or trauma, can be identified as being responsible for the acute (index) episode; (ii) patients in whom the index episode might be partly explained by the presence of a weak (minor) transient or reversible risk factor, or if a non-malignant risk factor for thrombosis persists; (iii) patients in whom the index episode occurred in the absence of any identifiable risk factor (the present Guidelines avoid terms such as 'unprovoked' or 'idiopathic' VTE); (iv) patients with one or more previous episodes of VTE, and those with a major persistent pro-thrombotic condition such as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome; and (v) patients with active cancer. 338

Table 11 shows examples of transient/reversible and persistent risk factors for VTE, classified by the risk of long-term recurrence. As active cancer is a major risk factor for recurrence of VTE, but also for bleeding while on anticoagulant treatment, 339 section 8.4 is specifically dedicated to the management of PE in patients with cancer.

Overall, assessment of the VTE recurrence risk after acute PE, in the absence of a major transient or reversible risk factor, is a complex issue. Beyond the examples listed in Table 11 , patients who are carriers of some forms of hereditary thrombophilia, notably those with confirmed deficiency of antithrombin, protein C, or protein S, and patients with homozygous factor V Leiden or homozygous prothrombin G20210A mutation, are often candidates for indefinite anticoagulant treatment after a first episode of PE occurring in the absence of a major reversible risk factor. In view of these possible implications, testing for thrombophilia (including antiphospholipid

antibodies and lupus anticoagulant) may be considered in patients in whom VTE occurs at a young age (e.g. aged <50 years) and in the absence of an otherwise identifiable risk factor, especially when this occurs against the background of a strong family history of VTE. In such cases, testing may help to tailor the regimen and dose of the anticoagulant agent over the long-term. On the other hand, no evidence of a clinical benefit of extended anticoagulant treatment is currently available for carriers of heterozygous factor V Leiden or prothrombin 20210A mutation.

A number of risk prediction models have been developed for the assessment of the risk of recurrence in an individual patient (Supplementary Data Table 13 ).$^{343,344}$The clinical value and, in particular, the possible therapeutic implications of these models in the NOAC era are unclear.

### 8.2 Anticoagulant-related bleeding risk

Incidence estimates from cohort studies conducted more than 15 years ago reported an ~ 3% annual incidence of major bleeding in patients treated with VKAs. 345 Meta-analyses of phase III studies focusing on the first 3 - 12 months of anticoagulant treatment showed an ~ 40% reduction in the risk for major bleeding with NOACs compared with VKAs. 346 The risk of major bleeding is higher in the first month of anticoagulant treatment, and then declines and remains stable over time. Based on currently available evidence, risk factors include: (i) advanced age (particularly >75 years); (ii) previous bleeding (if not associated with a reversible or treatable cause) or anaemia; (iii) active cancer; (iv) previous stroke, either haemorrhagic or ischaemic; (v) chronic renal or hepatic disease; (vi) concomitant antiplatelet therapy or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (to be avoided, if possible); (vii) other serious acute or chronic illness; and (viii) poor anticoagulation control.

Existing bleeding risk scores and their current validation status are reviewed in Supplementary Data Table 14 . The patient's bleeding risk should be assessed, either by implicit judgement after evaluating individual risk factors or by the use of a bleeding risk score, at the time of initiation of anticoagulant treatment. It should be reassessed periodically (e.g. once a year in patients at low risk, and every 3 or 6 months in patients at high risk for bleeding). Bleeding risk assessment should be used to identify and treat modifiable bleeding risk factors, and it may influence decision-making on the duration and regimen/dose of anticoagulant treatment after acute PE.

### 8.3 Regimens and treatment durations with non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants, and with other non-vitamin K antagonist antithrombotic drugs

All patients with PE should be treated with anticoagulants for > \_3 months. Beyond this period, the balance between the risk of VTE recurrence and that of bleeding, which has been used to select candidates for extended anticoagulation after a first VTE event in the VKA era, is currently being revisited based on the lower bleeding rates with NOACs. However, despite the improved safety of these drugs compared with VKAs, treatment

with NOACs is not without risk. Phase III clinical trials on the extended treatment of VTE have shown that the rate of major bleeding may be ~ 1%, and that of clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding as high as 6%. Bleeding rates may be higher in everyday clinical practice. 348,349

The NOAC trials that focused on extended VTE treatment are summarized in Supplementary Data Table 15 . In all studies, patients with PE made up approximately one-third of the entire study population, while the remaining two-thirds were patients with proximal DVT but no clinically overt PE. Patients needed to have completed the initial and long-term anticoagulation phase to be included in the extended studies.

Dabigatran was compared with warfarin or placebo in two different studies (Supplementary Data Table 15 ). 350 In these studies, dabigatran was non-inferior to warfarin for the prevention of confirmed recurrent symptomatic VTE or VTE-related death, and more effective than placebo for the prevention of symptomatic recurrent VTE or unexplained death. 350 The rate of major bleeding was 0.9% with dabigatran compared to 1.8% with warfarin (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.27 - 1.02). 350

Rivaroxaban was compared with placebo or aspirin in two different studies in patients who had completed 6 - 12 months of anticoagulation treatment for a first VTE event (Supplementary Data Table 15 ). Treatment with rivaroxaban [20 mg once a day (o.d.)] reduced recurrent VTE by ~ 80%, with a 6.0% incidence of major or CRNM bleeding as compared to 1.2% with placebo. 351 Rivaroxaban given at a dose of 20 or 10 mg o.d. was compared with aspirin (100 mg o.d.) in 3365 patients. 352 Both doses of rivaroxaban reduced symptomatic recurrent fatal or non-fatal VTE by GLYPH<C24> 70% in comparison with aspirin. No significant differences in the rates of major or CRNM bleeding were shown between either dose of rivaroxaban and aspirin. 352

Patients with VTE were randomized to receive two different doses of apixaban [2.5 or 5 mg twice a day (bis in die: b.i.d.)] or placebo after 6 - 12 months of initial anticoagulation (Supplementary Data Table 15 ). 353 Both doses of apixaban reduced the incidence of symptomatic recurrent VTE or death from any cause compared with placebo, with no safety concerns. 353

Patients at high bleeding risk-based on the investigator's judgement, the patient's medical history, and the results of laboratory examinations-were excluded from the extension studies mentioned above; this was also the case for studies on extended anticoagulation with VKAs. 330,331 This fact should be taken into account during triage of a patient for extended anticoagulation with one of the above regimens.

In a randomized, open-label study in high-risk patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (testing triple positive for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and antib 2-glycoprotein I), rivaroxaban was associated with an increased rate of thromboembolic and major bleeding events compared with warfarin (HR for the composite primary outcome 6.7; 95% CI 1.5 - 30.5). 354 At present, NOACs are not an alternative to VKAs for patients with antiphospholipid syndrome.

In two trials with a total of 1224 patients, extended therapy with aspirin (after termination of standard oral anticoagulation) was associated with a 30 - 35% reduction in the risk of recurrence compared with placebo (Supplementary Data Table 15 ). However, more recently, another trial demonstrated the superiority of anticoagulation with rivaroxaban, either 20 or 10 mg o.d., over aspirin for secondary prophylaxis of VTE recurrence. 352

A randomized, placebo controlled study evaluated sulodexide (2 * 250 lipasemic unit capsules b.i.d.) for the prevention of recurrence in 615 patients with a first VTE event without an identifiable risk factor, who had completed 3 - 12 months of oral anticoagulant treatment (Supplementary Data Table 15 ). 357 Sulodexide reduced the risk of recurrence by ~ 50% with no apparent increase in bleeding events. However, only 8% of patients in this study had PE as the index VTE event.

### 8.5 Management of pulmonary embolism in patients with cancer

Five RCTs compared LMWH vs. conventional VTE treatment (heparin followed by VKA) in the treatment of VTE in cancer-associated thrombosis. In 2003, a significant reduction in VTE recurrence was reported with LMWH compared with conventional (VKA) treatment without an increase in bleeding complications. In a more recent trial, long-term administration of tinzaparin failed to achieve a statistically significant reduction in overall VTE recurrence over conventional treatment (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.41 - 1.03); however, the overall rate of recurrent VTE in the control arm was lower than that previously observed, probably as a result of the recruitment of patients with a lower cancer-specific thrombotic risk. Overall, LMWHs were found to decrease the risk of recurrent VTE by 40% with a risk of major bleeding complications similar to that of VKAs. 365 Accordingly, LMWHs have become the standard of care. However, these agents are associated with a relevant cost and burden for patients. In addition, the absolute rate of recurrent VTE while on LMWH remains high (7 - 9%) compared with that observed in noncancer patients with VTE on conventional treatment (1.5 - 3%).

NOACs could make the treatment of VTE easier and more convenient in patients with cancer, due to their oral administration i nfixe d-dose regimens and their lower cost compared with LMWH. However, only 3 - 9% of patients included in phase III studies with NOACs for the treatment of VTE had concomitant cancer. A randomized, open-label trial compared edoxaban with LMWH in the secondary prevention of VTE in 1050 patients with cancer-associated thrombosis (mostly symptomatic or asymptomatic PE).$^{366}$Edoxaban (60 mg o.d., reduced to 30 mg in subjects with moderate renal impairment, low body weight, or concomitant need for strong inhibitors of glycoprotein-P) was started after 5 days of LMWH and treatment was given for > \_6 months. Edoxaban was non-inferior to dalteparin in the prevention of VTE recurrence or major bleeding over 12 months after randomization (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.70 - 1.36). Major bleeding occurred in 6.9% of the patients in the edoxaban arm and 4.0% in the dalteparin arm (difference in risk 2.9 percentage points, 95% CI 0.1 - 5.6). This difference appears to have been mainly accounted for by the high rate of bleeding in patients with gastrointestinal cancer allocated to the edoxaban group. 366 Similar results were reported by a randomized, open-label pilot trial comparing rivaroxaban with dalteparin in 406 patients with VTE and cancer, 58% of whom had metastases. 367 A significant decrease in the risk of recurrent VTE was observed with rivaroxaban (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.19 - 0.99). The 6 month cumulative rate of major bleeding, which was mostly gastrointestinal, was 6% (95% CI 3 - 11%) for rivaroxaban and 4% (95% CI 2 - 8%) for dalteparin (HR 1.83, 95% CI 0.68 - 4.96). Corresponding rates of CRNM bleeds were 13% (95% CI 9 - 19%) and 4% (95% CI 2 - 9%), respectively (HR 3.76, 95% CI 1.63 - 8.69).

Based on the currently available evidence, as described above, patients with acute PE and cancer, particularly those with gastrointestinal cancer, should be encouraged to continue LMWH for > \_3 - 6 months. This also applies to patients in whom oral treatment is unfeasible due to problems of intake or absorption, and to those with

severe renal impairment. In all other cases, especially in patients with an anticipated low risk of bleeding and without gastrointestinal tumours, the choice between LMWH and edoxaban or rivaroxaban is left to the discretion of the physician, and the patient's preference.

Owing to the high risk for recurrence, patients with cancer should receive indefinite anticoagulation after a first episode of VTE. Although existing evidence is limited, it is conceivable that once cancer is cured the risk for recurrence decreases and anticoagulation can be stopped. However, the definition of cured cancer is not always clear. The risk of recurrence of PE in cancer was assessed in a cohort study of 543 patients and was validated in an independent set of 819 patients. 368 The proposed score to predict the risk of recurrence included breast cancer (minus 1 point), Tumour Node Metastasis stage I or II (minus 1 point), and female sex, lung cancer, and previous VTE (plus 1 point each). Patients with a score < \_0 were at low risk (< \_4.5%) and those with a score > \_1 were at high (> \_19%) risk of VTE recurrence over the first 6 months.

After the first 3 - 6 months, extended anticoagulation may consist of continuation of LMWH or transition to an oral anticoagulant. Two cohort studies have assessed the safety of extended treatment with LMWH (< \_12 months) in cancer-associated thrombosis. In both studies, the incidence of bleeding complications was higher in the first months and then reached a plateau that remained unchanged after the sixth month. In the absence of conclusive evidence, the decision to continue with LMWH or to change to VKA or a NOAC should be made on a case-by-case basis after consideration of the success of anticancer therapy, the estimated risk of recurrence of VTE, the bleeding risk, and the preference of the patient. Periodic reassessment of the risk-to-benefit ratio of continued anticoagulant treatment is mandatory.

As mentioned in section 5, venous filters are principally indicated when anticoagulation is impossible due to active haemorrhage or an excessive bleeding risk. However, the risk of VTE recurrence in the absence of anticoagulation is particularly high in patients with cancer, and the insertion of a filter should not delay the initiation of anticoagulation as soon as it is safe to do so. There is no evidence to support the use of venous filters as an adjunct to anticoagulation treatment in patients with cancer.

A number of studies have reported that a proportion of patients presenting with PE in the absence of identifiable risk factors develop cancer within the first year after diagnosis. Consequently, the optimal strategy to achieve early diagnosis of these occult cancers was investigated. Two large randomized trials failed to show that comprehensive CT of the abdomen or $^{18}$F deoxy-fluoro-glucose positron emission tomography were able to detect more cancers than limited screening in patients with an unprovoked VTE. Therefore, based on current evidence, the search for occult cancer after an episode of VTE may be restricted to careful history taking, physical examination, basic laboratory tests, and a chest X-ray (if no CTPA was performed to diagnose PE).

In patients with cancer, incidental PE should be managed in the same manner as symptomatic PE, whether it involves segmental or more proximal branches, multiple subsegmental vessels, or a single subsegmental vessel in association with detectable DVT.

## 11 Non-thrombotic pulmonary embolism

This section is included in the Supplementary Data available online on the EHJ and ESC websites (www.escardio.org/guidelines).

Different cell types can cause non-thrombotic embolization, including adipocytes, and haematopoietic, amniotic, trophoblastic, and tumour cells. In addition, bacteria, fungi, parasites, foreign materials, and gas can lead to PE. Symptoms are similar to those of acute VTE and include dyspnoea, tachycardia, chest pain, cough, and occasionally haemoptysis, cyanosis, and syncope.

Diagnosis of non-thrombotic PE can be a challenge. In the case of small particles, microemboli cannot be detected on CT images. Given the rarity of this disease, clinical evidence is limited and based mainly on small case series.

### 11.1 Septic embolism

Septic embolism to the pulmonary circulation is a relatively rare clinical event and is commonly associated with right-sided endocarditis. Risk factors include i.v. drug abuse, and infected indwelling catheters or pacemaker wires. Other causes include septic thrombophlebitis from the tonsils and the jugular, dental, and pelvic regions. Septic embolism usually manifests as multiple lung nodules, infiltrates, or abscesses in an infectious context. With the exception of infected pacemaker wires, septic embolism is not associated with PH. The diagnosis is based on identifying the source of septic emboli, positive blood culture tests, and chest X-ray or CT after considering the clinical context; there are no filling contrast defects on CTPA. Although Staphylococcus aureus is the most common bacterial pathogen, the

increasing number of immunocompromised patients-and those with indwelling catheters and vascular prostheses-has led to a rise in the incidence of anaerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, bacterioidae species, and fungi. 60 Specific treatment of the responsible bacterial or fungal microorganism is necessary.

### 11.2 Foreign-material pulmonary embolism

The increasing use of interventional techniques in modern medicine has drastically increased the incidence of foreign-material PE. 61 Examples of foreign material include silicone, broken catheters, guide wires, vena cava filters, coils for embolization, cement from vertebroplasty, and endovascular stent components. If possible, intravascular foreign objects should be removed as the material may cause further thrombosis and sepsis.

### 11.3 Fat embolism

Embolization of fat occurs in almost all patients with pelvic or longbone fractures, and in those undergoing endomedullary nailing or placement of knee and hip prostheses. It also occurs during lipid and propofol infusion, intraosseous infusion, and bone marrow harvest, and in sickle cell disease, fatty liver disease, pancreatitis, and after liposuction. Pulmonary involvement is not only due to vascular obstruction but also to the release of substances triggering an inflammatory cascade, explaining why some patients with fat embolism develop acute respiratory distress syndrome.

The classical triad of fat embolization is characterized by altered mental status, respiratory distress, and petechial rash occurring typically 12 - 36 h after injury. Fat globules can be found in the blood, urine, sputum, broncho-alveolar lavage, and cerebrospinal fluid. 63 In most cases, the condition is self-limiting. Treatment should be supportive. Although the successful use of high doses of methyl prednisolone has been reported in humans, along with the positive effects of phorbol myristate acetate and sivelestat in animals, there is no evidence that these drugs alter the course of the disease.

### 11.4 Air embolism

Although air embolism can occur in both the venous and arterial systems, venous emboli are more common. Venous air embolization is often an iatrogenic complication of the manipulation of central venous and haemodialysis catheters. The lethal volume of air after injection in humans is estimated to range from 100 - 500 mL. 65 The major effect of venous air embolism is the obstruction of the RV out -flow tract or of the pulmonary arterioles, by a mixture of air bubbles and fibrin. Although the diagnosis can be made by X-ray or echocardiography, CT scanning may be the most sensitive diagnostic test, showing a unique picture of round or mirror-shaped densities localized ventrally in the supine patient. 66 Treatment includes maintenance of the circulation, the prevention of further entry of gas, high -flow oxygen, and volume expansion. The patient should be placed in the left lateral decubitus position to prevent RV outflow obstruction by airlock. 67 In the case of large amounts of central air, aspiration via the use of a central venous catheter might be an option.

### 11.5 Tumour embolism

Pulmonary intravascular tumour emboli are seen in < \_26% of autopsies of patients with solid malignancies, although the diagnosis is rarely made before death. Carcinomas of the prostate, digestive system, liver, kidney, and breast are most commonly implicated. Radiologically, tumour microembolism may mimic many lung conditions, including pneumonia, tuberculosis, and interstitial lung disease, whereas tumour macroembolism is indistinguishable from VTE. Treatment should target the underlying malignant disease. Anticoagulant treatment is often prescribed in this context because tumour embolism and VTE are difficult to distinguish.

### 12 Key messages

The ESC Task Force has selected 10 simple key messages and rules to guide physicians in the diagnosis and management of PE:

- (1) In patients presenting with haemodynamic instability, perform bedside TTE as a fast, immediate step to differentiate suspected highrisk PE from other acute life-threatening situations.
- (2) If you suspect acute PE, institute anticoagulation therapy as soon as possible, while the diagnostic workup is ongoing, unless the patient is bleeding or has absolute contraindications to this therapy.
- (3) Use recommended, validated diagnostic algorithms for PE, including standardized assessment of (pre-test) clinical probability and D-dimer testing. They help to avoid unnecessary, expensive, and potentially harmful imaging tests and exposure to ionizing radiation.
- (4) If the CTPA report suggests single subsegmental PE, consider the possibility of a false-positive finding. Discuss the findings again with the radiologist and/or seek a second opinion to avoid misdiagnosis, and unnecessary, potentially harmful anticoagulation treatment.
- (5) Confirmation of PE in a patient, without haemodynamic instability, must be followed by further risk assessment involving clinical findings, evaluation of the size and/or function of the RV, and laboratory biomarkers as appropriate. This information will help you to decide on the need for reperfusion treatment or monitoring for patients at elevated risk, or consider the option of early discharge and continuation of anticoagulation on an ambulatory basis for patients at low risk.
- (6) As soon as you diagnose (or strongly suspect) high-risk PE, select the best reperfusion option (systemic thrombolysis, surgical embolectomy, or catheter-directed treatment) considering the patient's risk profile, and the resources and expertise available at your hospital. For patients with intermediate-high-risk PE, reperfusion is not first-line treatment, but you should prospectively plan the management strategy with your team to have a contingency plan ready if the situation deteriorates.
- (7) Prefer anticoagulation with a NOAC over the 'traditional' LMWH-VKA regimen unless the patient has contraindication(s) to this type of drug.
- (8) Always remember that, with the exception of acute PE provoked by a strong transient/reversible risk factor, there is a lifelong risk of VTE recurrence after a first episode of PE. Consequently, reexamine the patient after the first 3 - 6 months of anticoagulation, weigh the benefits vs. risks of continuing treatment, and decide on the extension and dose of anticoagulant therapy, also considering the patient's preference. Remember to recommend regular follow-up examinations, e.g. at yearly intervals.
- (9) If you suspect PE in a pregnant patient, consider diagnostic pathways and algorithms including CTPA or V/Q lung scan, which can be used safely during pregnancy.
- (10) After acute PE, patients should not be lost to follow-up. Apart from checking for possible signs of VTE recurrence, cancer, or bleeding complications of anticoagulation, ask the patient if there is persisting or new-onset dyspnoea or functional limitation. If yes, implement a staged diagnostic workup to exclude CTEPH or chronic thromboembolic disease, and to detect/treat comorbidity or 'simple' deconditioning. Follow-up imaging is not routinely recommended in an asymptomatic patient, but it may be considered in patients with risk factors for development of CTEPH.

## 13 Gaps in the evidence

### Diagnosis

- The optimal method to adjust (based on the patient's age or in combination with clinical probability) the D-dimer threshold, permitting the exclusion of PE while reducing the number of unnecessary imaging tests to a minimum, remains to be determined.
- The diagnostic value and clinical significance of isolated subsegmental contrast-filling defects in the modern CTPA era remain controversial.
- No robust data exist to guide the decision on whether to treat incidental PE with anticoagulants compared with a strategy of watchful waiting.
- For patients presenting with non-traumatic chest pain, the benefits vs. risks of 'triple rule-out' (for coronary artery disease, PE, and aortic dissection) CT angiography need further evaluation before such an approach can be routinely recommended.

### Assessment of pulmonary embolism severity and the risk of early death

- The optimal, clinically most relevant combination (and cut-off levels) of clinical and biochemical predictors of early PE-related death remain to be determined, particularly with regard to identifying possible candidates for reperfusion treatment among patients with intermediate-risk PE.
- The need for assessment of the RV status in addition to clinical parameters, to classify a patient with acute symptomatic PE as being at low vs. intermediate risk, needs to be confirmed by further prospective management (cohort) studies.

### Treatment in the acute phase

- The clinical benefits vs. risks of reduced-dose thrombolysis and catheter-based reperfusion modalities in patients with intermediate-high-risk PE should be evaluated in prospective randomized trials.
- The place of ECMO in the management of acute high-risk PE awaits support by additional evidence from prospective management (cohort) studies.
- The optimal anticoagulant drug(s) and regimen in patients with renal insufficiency and CrCl <30 mL/min remain unclear.
- The criteria for selecting patients for early discharge and outpatient treatment of PE, and particularly the need for assessment of the RV status with imaging methods and/or laboratory markers in addition to calculating a clinical score, need to be further validated in prospective cohort studies.

### Chronic treatment and prevention of recurrence

- The clinical value and the possible therapeutic implications of models or scores assessing the risk of VTE recurrence, and the risk of bleeding under anticoagulation, need to be revisited in the NOAC era.
- The effectiveness of extended treatment with a reduced dose, or apixaban or rivaroxaban, should be confirmed in patients with a high risk of recurrent PE.
- The evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of NOACs for the treatment of PE in patients with cancer needs to be extended by further studies.
- In patients with cancer, the anticoagulant regimen and dose after the first 6 months should be clarified and prospectively tested.
- The optimal time for discontinuing anticoagulant treatment after an episode of acute PE in patients with cancer is yet to be determined.

## Pulmonary embolism and pregnancy

- Diagnostic algorithms for PE in pregnancy, using modern radiological imaging techniques and low radiation doses, need to be prospectively tested in adequately powered cohort studies.
- Controversy persists on the optimal LMWH dose and regimen for the treatment of PE during pregnancy.
- NOACs are not allowed in pregnancy. However, if exposure to these drugs occurs during pregnancy despite this warning, any possible effects on the foetus should be recorded to provide more precise information on the risks and complications of these drugs, and adapt the instructions to physicians in the future.

### Long-term sequelae of pulmonary embolism

- The optimal follow-up strategy, including the spectrum of diagnostic tests that may be necessary, in patients with persisting symptoms and functional limitation after acute PE needs to be defined and prospectively validated.
- In the absence of persisting symptoms or functional limitation after acute PE, the criteria for identifying patients whose risk of developing CTEPH may be sufficientlyhightojustifyfurtherdiagnostic workup require further elaboration and validation in prospective cohort studies.
