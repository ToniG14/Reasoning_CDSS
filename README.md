2. **Service Selection**: 
   - **Guidelines Consultation**: Ask questions about PE clinical guidelines
   - **Clinical Case Evaluation**: Ask to get personalized recommendations for the selected patient
3. **Interactive Process**: The system will guide you through the clinical reasoning process
4. **Results**: Receive evidence-based recommendations with source citations

### Example Queries

#### Guidelines Consultation
- "What are the diagnostic criteria for pulmonary embolism?"
- "When should thrombolytic therapy be considered?"
- "What are the contraindications for anticoagulation?"

#### Clinical Case Evaluation
- "Help me with this clinical case"
- "How should I proceed with the selected patient?"
- "Analyze this patient"

## Document Ingestion

The system includes a complete pipeline for ingesting new medical documents and creating vector stores.

### Using the Ingestion Pipeline

1. **Open the ingestion notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook ingestion/Ingestion.ipynb
   ```

2. **PDF to Markdown Conversion**:
   - Uses Docling for accurate medical document conversion
   - Preserves document structure and formatting
   - Handles tables, figures, and references

3. **Document Processing**:
   - Intelligent chunking using markdown headers
   - Metadata extraction and cross-reference handling
   - Duplicate content removal

4. **Vector Store Creation**:
   - Uses OpenAI embeddings (text-embedding-3-large)
   - Stores in Chroma vector database
   - Supports semantic search and retrieval

### Ingestion Steps

```python
# 1. Convert PDF to Markdown
convert_pdf_to_markdown(pdf_path, markdown_path)

# 2. Process markdown files
markdown_documents = read_markdown_files(markdown_folder)

# 3. Create vector store
vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(
    documents=processed_chunks,
    embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-large"),
    collection_name="your_collection_name",
    persist_directory="vectorstores/your_directory"
)
```

## System Architecture: Complete Node Graph

The CDSS system is built as a sophisticated multi-agent workflow using LangGraph. Below is the complete system architecture showing all nodes and their relationships:

![System Graph](graph.png)

### Complete Node Breakdown

#### 🏁 **Entry Point Nodes**
- **START**: System initialization point
- **Patient Processor**: Loads patient data from Excel files, handles patient selection (1-20), and initializes patient state
- **Query Input**: Manages user input and query processing, handles interactive communication with healthcare professionals
- **Orchestrator**: Central routing agent that classifies queries and directs them to appropriate service pathways

#### 📋 **Guidelines Consultation Pathway**
- **Query Solver**: Main agent for processing clinical guideline queries, performs multi-step reasoning and coordinates information retrieval
- **Dynamic Retrieval Tool**: Retrieves relevant information from PE guidelines vectorstore, supports semantic search and re-ranking

#### 🏥 **Clinical Case Evaluation Pathway**

##### Clinical Metrics Calculation
- **PESI Parameters Evaluator**: Identifies required parameters for PESI/sPESI calculation, checks for missing patient data
- **PESI Patient Data Request Tool**: Requests missing patient data specifically for PESI calculation
- **PESI Calculator**: Computes PESI (Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index) and sPESI (Simplified PESI) scores for mortality risk assessment


- **ROEM Parameters Evaluator**: Identifies parameters needed for Risk of Early Mortality calculation
- **ROEM Patient Data Request Tool**: Requests missing patient data for mortality risk assessment
- **ROEM Calculator**: Calculates comprehensive Risk of Early Mortality classification

##### Clinical Decision Making
- **Clinical Case Evaluator**: Multi-turn reasoning agent that:
  - Analyzes patient data and calculated metrics
  - Performs clinical reasoning across multiple steps
  - Coordinates information retrieval and data requests
  - Prepares for final recommendation generation
- **Patient Data Request Tool**: General tool for requesting missing patient parameters during clinical evaluation
- **Dynamic Retrieval Tool 2**: Secondary retrieval tool for guidelines information during clinical evaluation
- **Clinical Case Report Generator**: Generates final clinical recommendations with:
  - Patient state assessment
  - Diagnosis determination
  - Diagnostic/Treatment recommendations
  - Safety considerations and contraindications

#### 🔚 **Session Management**
- **Finish Session**: Handles session termination and cleanup

### Node Interaction Flow

1. **Initialization**: START → Patient Processor → Query Input → Orchestrator
2. **Guidelines Consultation**: Orchestrator → Query Solver ⇄ Dynamic Retrieval Tool → Query Input
3. **Clinical Evaluation**: Orchestrator → PESI Parameters Evaluator → PESI Calculator → ROEM Parameters Evaluator → ROEM Calculator → Clinical Case Evaluator → Clinical Case Report Generator → Query Input
4. **Data Requests**: Any evaluator can route to data request tools when patient information is missing
5. **Information Retrieval**: Clinical Case Evaluator can call Dynamic Retrieval Tool 2 for additional guideline information
6. **Session End**: Any point → Finish Session

### Key Features of the Architecture

- **Conditional Routing**: Smart routing based on agent decisions and patient data availability
- **Memory Persistence**: LangGraph checkpoint system maintains conversation state
- **Uncertainty Handling**: Robust handling of missing data and failed operations
- **Multi-turn Reasoning**: Agents can perform multiple reasoning steps before generating final outputs
- **Safety Checks**: Built-in verification and hallucination detection at multiple stages

## Safety Features

- **Hallucination Detection**: Prevents unsafe or inaccurate recommendations
- **Contraindication Checking**: Automatically considers patient-specific contraindications
- **Evidence-Based Responses**: All recommendations are grounded in official guidelines
- **Transparent Reasoning**: Provides step-by-step clinical reasoning
- **Source Citation**: All responses include references to source documents

## Evaluation

The system has been evaluated using:
- **Clinical Case Evaluation Dataset**: 20 simulated patient cases
- **Guidelines Consultation Dataset**: Clinical questions with three difficulty levels
- **Expert Validation**: Clinical expert review of recommendations
- **Automated Metrics**: Context precision, relevance, and factual accuracy
