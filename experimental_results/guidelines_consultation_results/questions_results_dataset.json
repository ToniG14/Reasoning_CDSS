            "The increased awareness of venous thromboembolic disease and the ever-increasing availability of non-invasive imaging tests, mainly computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography (CTPA), have generated a tendency for clinicians to suspect and initiate a diagnostic workup for PE more frequently than in the past. This changing attitude is illustrated by the rates of PE confirmation among patients undergoing diagnostic workup: these were as low as 5% in recent North American diagnostic studies, in sharp contrast to the approximately 50% prevalence reported back in the early 1980s. Therefore, it is critical that, when evaluating non-invasive diagnostic strategies for PE in the modern era, it is ensured that they are capable of safely excluding PE in contemporary patient populations with a rather low pre-test probability of the disease. Conversely, a positive test should have an adequate specificity to set the indication for anticoagulant treatment.",

        "response": "Epidemiological data from the guidelines indicate that the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes pulmonary embolism (PE), is almost eight times higher in individuals aged over 80 years compared to those in their fifth decade of life (i.e., in their 50s). Specifically, annual incidence rates for PE range from 39 to 115 per 100,000 population overall, but cross-sectional data show a marked increase with age, with the elderly (>80 years) experiencing a substantially higher incidence.\n\nThis significant age-related increase in PE incidence underscores the importance of heightened clinical vigilance and appropriate diagnostic strategies in the elderly population, who are at considerably greater risk than middle-aged adults. The data also reflect a rising trend in PE incidence over time, which may further impact healthcare systems given the aging population.\n\nIn summary, patients over 80 years old have an approximately eightfold higher incidence of PE compared to those in their 50s, highlighting the critical need for age-tailored diagnostic and management approaches in this high-risk group."

It allows adequate visualization of the pulmonary arteries down to the subsegmental level. The Prospective Investigation On Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis (PIOPED) II study observed a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 96% for (mainly four-detector) CTPA in PE diagnosis. 115 PIOPED II also highlighted the influence of pre-test clinical probability on the predictive value of multidetector CTPA. In patients with a low or intermediate clinical probability of PE, a negative CTPA had a high negative predictive value for PE (96 and 89%, respectively), but its negative predictive value was only 60% if the pre-test probability was high. Conversely, the positive predictive value of a positive CTPA was high (92 - 96%) in patients with an intermediate or high clinical probability, but much lower (58%) in patients with a low pre-test likelihood of PE. 115 Therefore, clinicians should consider further testing in case of discordance between clinical judgement and the CTPA result.  \nSeveral studies have provided evidence in favour of CTPA as a stand-alone imaging test for excluding PE. Taken together, the available data suggest that a negative CTPA result is an adequate criterion for the exclusion of PE in patients with low or intermediate clinical probability of PE. On the other hand, it remains controversial whether patients with a negative CTPA and a high clinical probability should be further investigated.  \nChronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a potentially fatal late sequela of PE, but pre-existing CTEPH should not be missed in patients investigated for suspected acute PE.

Cardiac arrest: requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\n2. Obstructive shock: characterized by systolic blood pressure (BP) < 90 mmHg or the need for vasopressors to maintain a BP ≥ 90 mmHg despite adequate fluid filling status, combined with signs of end-organ hypoperfusion such as altered mental status, cold and clammy skin, oliguria or anuria, and increased serum lactate.\n3. Persistent hypotension: defined as systolic BP < 90 mmHg or a systolic BP drop ≥ 40 mmHg lasting longer than 15 minutes, not caused by new-onset arrhythmia, hypovolaemia, or sepsis.\n\nThis definition is critical because haemodynamic instability reflects acute right ventricular (RV) failure due to impaired RV filling and/or reduced RV output, which is a major determinant of clinical severity and early mortality risk in acute PE. Patients with haemodynamic instability are classified as having high-risk PE and require immediate diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.\n\nIn summary, haemodynamic instability in PE is identified by cardiac arrest, obstructive shock with hypotension and end-organ hypoperfusion, or persistent hypotension not attributable to other causes, indicating a high-risk clinical presentation necessitating urgent management.

            "The combination of symptoms and clinical findings with the presence of predisposing factors for VTE allows the classification of patients with suspected PE into distinct categories of clinical or pre-test probability, which correspond to an increasing actual prevalence of confirmed PE. This pre-test assessment can be done either by implicit (empirical) clinical judgement or by using prediction rules. As the post-test (i.e. after an imaging test) probability of PE depends not only on the characteristics of the diagnostic test itself but also on the pretest probability, this is a key step in all diagnostic algorithms for PE.  \nThe value of empirical clinical judgement has been confirmed in several large series. Clinical judgement usually includes commonplace tests such as chest X-rays and electrocardiograms for differential diagnosis. However, as clinical judgement lacks standardization, several explicit clinical prediction rules have been developed. Of these, the most frequently used prediction rules are the revised Geneva rule ( Table 5 ) and the Wells rule (see Supplementary Data Table 1). Both prediction rules have been simplified in an attempt to increase their adoption into clinical practice; the simplified versions have been externally validated.  \nRegardless of the score used, the proportion of patients with confirmed PE can be expected to be ~ 10% in the low-probability category, 30% in the moderate-probability category, and 65% in the highprobability category. When the two-level classification is used, the proportion of patients with confirmed PE is ~ 12% in the PE-unlikely category and 30% in the PE-likely category. A direct prospective comparison of these rules confirmed a similar diagnostic performance.",

            "D-dimer levels are elevated in plasma in the presence of acute thrombosis because of simultaneous activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis. The negative predictive value of D-dimer testing is high, and a normal D-dimer level renders acute PE or DVT unlikely. On the other hand, the positive predictive value of elevated D-dimer levels is low and D-dimer testing is not useful for confirmation of PE. D-dimer is also more frequently elevated in patients with cancer, in hospitalized patients, 89,98 in severe infection or inflammatory disease, and during pregnancy. Accordingly, the number of patients in whom D-dimer must be measured to exclude one PE (number needed to test) rises from 3 in the general population of an emergency department to > \\_10 in the specific situations listed above.  \nAs a number of D-dimer assays are available, clinicians should become aware of the diagnostic performance of the test used in their own hospital. The quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or ELISA-derived assays have a diagnostic sensitivity of > \\_95%, and can be used to exclude PE in patients with either low or intermediate pre-test probability. In the emergency department, a negative ELISA D-dimer can, in combination with clinical probability, exclude the disease without further testing in ~ 30% of patients with suspected PE. Outcome studies have shown that the 3 month thrombo-bolic risk was <1% in patients with low or intermediate clinical probability who were left untreated on the basis of a negative test result.",
            "The proposed strategy based on CTPA is shown in Figure 5 .Inpatients admitted to the emergency department, measurement of plasma Ddimer is the logical first step following the assessment of clinical probability and allows PE to be ruled out in GLYPH<C24> 30% of outpatients. D-dimer should not be measured in patients with a high clinical probability of PE, owing to a low negative predictive value in this population. 323 It is also less useful in hospitalized patients because the number that needs to be tested to obtain a clinically relevant negative result is high.  \nIn most centres, multidetector CTPA is the second-line test in patients with an elevated D-dimer level and the first-line test in patients with a high clinical probability of PE. CTPA is considered to be diagnostic of PE when it shows a clot at least at the segmental level of the pulmonary arterial tree. False-negative results of CTPA have been reported in patients with a high clinical probability of PE; 115 however, such discrepancies are infrequent and the 3 month thromboembolic risk was low in these patients. 171 Accordingly, both the necessity of performing further tests and the nature of these tests remain controversial in these clinical situations.",
            "The specificity of D-dimer in suspected PE decreases steadily with age to ~ 10% in patients >80 years of age. 105 The use of age-adjusted cutoffs may improve the performance of D-dimer testing in the elderly. A multinational prospective management study evaluated a previously validated age-adjusted cut-off (age ~ 10 m g/L, for patients aged >50 years) in a cohort of 3346 patients. 106 Patients with a normal ageadjusted D-dimer value did not undergo CTPA; they were left untreated and followed for a 3 month period.

        "response": "Plasma D-dimer measurement is recommended primarily in patients with a low or intermediate clinical probability of pulmonary embolism (PE) to reduce the need for unnecessary imaging. Specifically:\n\n1. Clinical Probability Assessment:\n   - Use clinical judgment or validated prediction rules to classify patients into low, intermediate, or high clinical probability categories (or alternatively, PE unlikely vs. PE likely).\n   - D-dimer testing is most useful in patients with low or intermediate clinical probability or those classified as PE unlikely.\n\n2. D-dimer Testing Utility:\n   - A negative D-dimer test in these patients (low/intermediate probability) effectively excludes PE, allowing avoidance of further imaging such as computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA).\n   - Highly sensitive D-dimer assays (e.g., ELISA or ELISA-derived) with >95% sensitivity are preferred, as they provide a high negative predictive value.\n   - In the emergency department setting, this strategy can exclude PE without further testing in approximately 30% of suspected cases with low or intermediate probability.\n\n3. Limitations and Exceptions:\n   - D-dimer measurement is not recommended in patients with a high clinical probability of PE because the negative predictive value is low in this group, and imaging should be performed directly.\n   - The test is less useful in hospitalized patients due to frequent elevations of D-dimer from other causes (e.g., cancer, infection, inflammation, pregnancy), which reduces specificity and increases the number needed to test to exclude one PE.\n   - In elderly patients, specificity decreases with age; age-adjusted D-dimer cutoffs (e.g., age × 10 µg/L for patients >50 years) may improve test performance and safely exclude PE in more patients without additional false negatives.\n\n4. Summary of Diagnostic Algorithm:\n   - For patients with low or intermediate clinical probability: measure plasma D-dimer.\n     - If negative: no further imaging or treatment required.\n     - If positive: proceed to CTPA.\n   - For patients with high clinical probability: proceed directly to CTPA without D-dimer testing.\n\nIn conclusion, plasma D-dimer measurement is recommended to reduce unnecessary imaging in patients with low or intermediate clinical probability of PE, using highly sensitive assays and considering age-adjusted cutoffs in the elderly. It is not recommended in patients with high clinical probability or in most hospitalized patients due to limited specificity and predictive value in these groups. This approach safely excludes PE in a significant proportion of patients, minimizing exposure to imaging and associated risks."

            "Echocardiographic parameters used to stratify the early risk of patients with PE are graphically presented in Figure 3 , and their prognostic values are summarized in Supplementary Data Table 3 .O f these, an RV/LV diameter ratio > \\_1.0 and a TAPSE <16 mm are the findings for which an association with unfavourable prognosis has most frequently been reported.  \nOverall, evidence for RV dysfunction on echocardiography is found in > \\_25% of unselected patients with acute PE. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have suggested that RV dysfunction on echocardiography is associated with an elevated risk of short-term mortality in patients who appear haemodynamically stable at presentation, 180,181 but its overall positive predictive value for PE-related death was low (<10%) in a metaanalysis. 180 This weakness is partly related to the fact that echocardiographic parameters have proved difficult to standardize. Nevertheless, echocardiographic assessment of the morphology and function of the RV is widely recognized as a valuable tool for the prognostic assessment of normotensive patients with acute PE in clinical practice.  \nIn addition to RV dysfunction, echocardiography can identify rightto-left shunt through a patent foramen ovale and the presence of right heart thrombi, both of which are associated with increased  \nmortality in patients with acute PE. A patent foramen ovale also increases the risk of ischaemic stroke due to paradoxical embolism in patients with acute PE and RV dysfunction.",
            "Acute PE may lead to RV pressure overload and dysfunction, which can be detected by echocardiography. Given the peculiar geometry of the RV, there is no individual echocardiographic parameter that provides fast and reliable information on RV size or function. This is why echocardiographic criteria for the diagnosis of PE have differed between studies. Because of the reported negative predictive value of 40 - 50%, a negative result cannot exclude PE. 124,142,143 On the other hand, signs of RV overload or dysfunction may also be found in the absence of acute PE, and may be due to concomitant cardiac or respiratory disease.  \nEchocardiographic findings of RV overload and/or dysfunction are graphically presented in Figure 3 . RV dilation is found in > \\_25% of patients with PE on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and is useful for risk stratification of the disease. 145 More specific echocardiographic findings were reported to retain a high positive predictive value for PE even in the presence of pre-existing cardiorespiratory disease. Thus, the combination of a pulmonary ejection acceleration time (measured in the RV outflow tract) <60 ms with a peak systolic tricuspid valve gradient <60 mmHg ('60/60' sign), or with depressed contractility of the RV free wall compared to the 'echocardiographic' RV apex (McConnell sign), is suggestive of PE. 146 However, these findings are present in only ~ 12 and 20% of unselected PE patients, respectively. 145 Detection of echocardiographic signs of RV pressure overload helps to distinguish acute PE from RV free wall hypokinesia or akinesia due to RV infarction, which may mimic the McConnell sign. 147 It should be noted that in ~ 10% of PE patients, echocardiography can show potentially misleading incidental findings such as significant LV systolic dysfunction or valvular heart disease. 145 Decreased tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) may also be present in PE patients. 148,149 Echocardiographic parameters of RV function derived from Doppler tissue imaging and wall strain assessment may also be affected by the presence of acute PE ( Figure 3 ). However, they probably have low sensitivity as stand-alone findings, as they were reported to be normal in haemodynamically stable patients despite the presence of PE.  \nEchocardiographic examination is not mandatory as part of the routine diagnostic workup in haemodynamically stable patients with suspected PE, 124 although it may be useful in the differential diagnosis of acute dyspnoea. This is in contrast to suspected high-risk PE, in which the absence of echocardiographic signs of RV overload or dysfunction practically excludes PE as the cause of haemodynamic instability. In the latter case, echocardiography may be of further help in the differential diagnosis of the cause of shock, by detecting pericardial tamponade, acute valvular dysfunction, severe global or regional LV dysfunction, aortic dissection, or hypovolaemia. 152 Conversely, in a haemodynamically compromised patient with suspected PE, unequivocal signs of RV pressure overload, especially with more specific echocardiographic findings (60/60 sign, McConnell sign, or rightheart thrombi), justify emergency reperfusion treatment for PE if immediate CT angiography is not feasible in a patient with high clinical probability and no other obvious causes for RV pressure overload.  \nMobile right-heart thrombi are detected by TTE or transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE), or by CT angiography, in <4% of unselected patients with PE. 153 - 155 Their prevalence may reach 18% among PE patients in the intensive care setting. 156 Mobile right-heart thrombi essentially confirm the diagnosis of PE and are associated with high early mortality, especially in patients with RV dysfunction.  \nIn some patients with suspected acute PE, echocardiography may detect increased RV wall thickness or tricuspid insufficiency jet velocity beyond values compatible with acute RV pressure overload (>3.8 m/s or a tricuspid valve peak systolic gradient >60 mmHg). In these cases, chronic thromboembolic (or other) pulmonary hypertension (PH) should be included in the differential diagnosis.",
            "The classification of PE severity and the risk of early (in-hospital or 30 day) death is summarized in Table 8 . Risk assessment of acute PE begins upon suspicion of the disease and initiation of the diagnostic workup. At this early stage, it is critical to identify patients with (suspected) high-risk PE. This clinical setting necessitates an emergency diagnostic algorithm ( Figure 4 ) and immediate referral for reperfusion treatment, as explained in section 7 , and displayed in Figure 6 and Supplementary Data Figure 1 . Testing for laboratory biomarkers such as cardiac troponins or natriuretic peptides is not necessary for immediate therapeutic decisions in patients with high-risk PE.  \nIn the absence of haemodynamic instability at presentation, further risk stratification of PE is recommended, as it has implications for early discharge vs. hospitalization or monitoring of the patient (explained in section 7 ). Table 8 provides an overview of the clinical, imaging, and laboratory parameters used to distinguish intermediateand low-risk PE. The PESI is-in its original or simplified form-the most extensively validated and most broadly used clinical score to date, as it integrates baseline indicators of the severity of the acute PE episode with aggravating conditions and the comorbidity of the patient. Overall, a PESI of class I - II or an sPESI of 0 is a reliable predictor of low-risk PE.  \nIn addition to clinical parameters, patients in the intermediate-risk group who display evidence of both RV dysfunction (on echocardiography or CTPA) and elevated cardiac biomarker levels in the circulation (particularly a positive cardiac troponin test) are classified into the intermediate-high-risk category. As will be discussed in more detail in section 7 , close monitoring is recommended in these cases to permit the early detection of haemodynamic decompensation or collapse, and consequently the need for rescue reperfusion therapy. 179 Patients in whom the RV appears normal on echocardiography or CTPA, and/or who have normal cardiac biomarker levels, belong to the intermediate-low-risk category. As an alternative approach, use of further prognostic scores combining clinical, imaging, and laboratory parameters may be considered to semi-quantitatively assess the severity of the PE episode, and distinguish intermediate-high-risk and intermediate-low-risk PE. Supplementary Data Table 4 lists the scores most frequently investigated for this purpose in observational (cohort) studies; however, none of them has been used in RCTs to date.  \nA recent meta-analysis included 21 cohort studies with a total of 3295 patients with 'low-risk' PE based on a PESI of I - II or an sPESI of 0. 234 Overall, 34% (95% CI 30 - 39%) of them were reported to have signs of RV dysfunction on echocardiography or CTPA. Data on early mortality were provided in seven studies (1597 patients) and revealed an OR of 4.19 (95% CI 1.39 - 12.58) for death from any cause in the presence of RV dysfunction; elevated cardiac troponin levels were associated with a comparable magnitude of risk elevation. 234 Early all-cause mortality rates (1.8% for RV dysfunction and 3.8% for elevated troponin levels) were in the lower range of those previously reported for patients with intermediate-risk PE. 235 Until the clinical implications of such discrepancies are clarified, patients with signs of RV dysfunction or elevated cardiac biomarkers, despite a low PESI or an sPESI of 0, should be classified into the intermediate-low-risk category.",

            "In addition to the clinical, imaging, and laboratory findings, which are directly linked to PE severity and PE-related early death, baseline parameters related to aggravating conditions and comorbidity are necessary to assess a patient's overall mortality risk and early outcome. Of the clinical scores integrating PE severity and comorbidity, the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) ( Table 7 ) is the one that has been most extensively validated to date. The principal strength of the PESI lies in the reliable identification of patients at low risk for 30 day mortality (PESI classes I and II). One randomized trial employed a low PESI as the principal inclusion criterion for home treatment of acute PE. 178  \nIn view of the complexity of the original PESI, which includes differently weighed variables, a simplified version (sPESI; Table 7) has been developed and validated. As with the original version of the PESI, the strength of the sPESI lies in the reliable identification of patients at low risk for 30 day mortality. The prognostic performance of the sPESI has been confirmed in observational cohort studies, although this index has not yet been prospectively used to guide therapeutic management of low-risk PE patients.  \nThe diagnosis of concomitant DVT has been identified as an adverse prognostic factor, being independently associated with death within the first 3 months after acute PE. In a meta-analysis investigating 8859 patients with PE, the presence of concomitant DVT was confirmed as a predictor of 30 day all-cause mortality (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.5 - 2.4), although it did not predict PE-related adverse outcomes at 90 days. Thus, concomitant DVT can be regarded as an indicator of significant comorbidity in acute PE.",

            "The classification of PE severity and the risk of early (in-hospital or 30 day) death is summarized in Table 8 . Risk assessment of acute PE begins upon suspicion of the disease and initiation of the diagnostic workup. At this early stage, it is critical to identify patients with (suspected) high-risk PE. This clinical setting necessitates an emergency diagnostic algorithm ( Figure 4 ) and immediate referral for reperfusion treatment, as explained in section 7 , and displayed in Figure 6 and Supplementary Data Figure 1 . Testing for laboratory biomarkers such as cardiac troponins or natriuretic peptides is not necessary for immediate therapeutic decisions in patients with high-risk PE.  \nIn the absence of haemodynamic instability at presentation, further risk stratification of PE is recommended, as it has implications for early discharge vs. hospitalization or monitoring of the patient (explained in section 7 ). Table 8 provides an overview of the clinical, imaging, and laboratory parameters used to distinguish intermediateand low-risk PE. The PESI is-in its original or simplified form-the most extensively validated and most broadly used clinical score to date, as it integrates baseline indicators of the severity of the acute PE episode with aggravating conditions and the comorbidity of the patient. Overall, a PESI of class I - II or an sPESI of 0 is a reliable predictor of low-risk PE.  \nIn addition to clinical parameters, patients in the intermediate-risk group who display evidence of both RV dysfunction (on echocardiography or CTPA) and elevated cardiac biomarker levels in the circulation (particularly a positive cardiac troponin test) are classified into the intermediate-high-risk category. As will be discussed in more detail in section 7 , close monitoring is recommended in these cases to permit the early detection of haemodynamic decompensation or collapse, and consequently the need for rescue reperfusion therapy. 179 Patients in whom the RV appears normal on echocardiography or CTPA, and/or who have normal cardiac biomarker levels, belong to the intermediate-low-risk category. As an alternative approach, use of further prognostic scores combining clinical, imaging, and laboratory parameters may be considered to semi-quantitatively assess the severity of the PE episode, and distinguish intermediate-high-risk and intermediate-low-risk PE. Supplementary Data Table 4 lists the scores most frequently investigated for this purpose in observational (cohort) studies; however, none of them has been used in RCTs to date.  \nA recent meta-analysis included 21 cohort studies with a total of 3295 patients with 'low-risk' PE based on a PESI of I - II or an sPESI of 0. 234 Overall, 34% (95% CI 30 - 39%) of them were reported to have signs of RV dysfunction on echocardiography or CTPA. Data on early mortality were provided in seven studies (1597 patients) and revealed an OR of 4.19 (95% CI 1.39 - 12.58) for death from any cause in the presence of RV dysfunction; elevated cardiac troponin levels were associated with a comparable magnitude of risk elevation. 234 Early all-cause mortality rates (1.8% for RV dysfunction and 3.8% for elevated troponin levels) were in the lower range of those previously reported for patients with intermediate-risk PE. 235 Until the clinical implications of such discrepancies are clarified, patients with signs of RV dysfunction or elevated cardiac biomarkers, despite a low PESI or an sPESI of 0, should be classified into the intermediate-low-risk category.",
            "Risk stratification of patients with acute PE is mandatory for determining the appropriate therapeutic management approach. As described in section 3.3 , initial risk stratification is based on clinical symptoms and signs of haemodynamic instability ( Table 4 ), which indicate a high risk of early death. In the large remaining group of patients with PE who present without haemodynamic instability, further (advanced) risk stratification requires the assessment of two sets of prognostic criteria: (i) clinical, imaging, and laboratory indicators of PE severity, mostly related to the presence of RV dysfunction; and (ii) presence of comorbidity and any other aggravating conditions that may adversely affect early prognosis.",

            "The classification of PE severity and the risk of early (in-hospital or 30 day) death is summarized in Table 8 . Risk assessment of acute PE begins upon suspicion of the disease and initiation of the diagnostic workup. At this early stage, it is critical to identify patients with (suspected) high-risk PE. This clinical setting necessitates an emergency diagnostic algorithm ( Figure 4 ) and immediate referral for reperfusion treatment, as explained in section 7 , and displayed in Figure 6 and Supplementary Data Figure 1 . Testing for laboratory biomarkers such as cardiac troponins or natriuretic peptides is not necessary for immediate therapeutic decisions in patients with high-risk PE.  \nIn the absence of haemodynamic instability at presentation, further risk stratification of PE is recommended, as it has implications for early discharge vs. hospitalization or monitoring of the patient (explained in section 7 ). Table 8 provides an overview of the clinical, imaging, and laboratory parameters used to distinguish intermediateand low-risk PE. The PESI is-in its original or simplified form-the most extensively validated and most broadly used clinical score to date, as it integrates baseline indicators of the severity of the acute PE episode with aggravating conditions and the comorbidity of the patient. Overall, a PESI of class I - II or an sPESI of 0 is a reliable predictor of low-risk PE.  \nIn addition to clinical parameters, patients in the intermediate-risk group who display evidence of both RV dysfunction (on echocardiography or CTPA) and elevated cardiac biomarker levels in the circulation (particularly a positive cardiac troponin test) are classified into the intermediate-high-risk category. As will be discussed in more detail in section 7 , close monitoring is recommended in these cases to permit the early detection of haemodynamic decompensation or collapse, and consequently the need for rescue reperfusion therapy. 179 Patients in whom the RV appears normal on echocardiography or CTPA, and/or who have normal cardiac biomarker levels, belong to the intermediate-low-risk category. As an alternative approach, use of further prognostic scores combining clinical, imaging, and laboratory parameters may be considered to semi-quantitatively assess the severity of the PE episode, and distinguish intermediate-high-risk and intermediate-low-risk PE.

Accordingly, clinical symptoms, and signs of overt RV failure and haemodynamic instability, indicate a high risk of early (in-hospital or 30 day) mortality. High-risk PE is defined by haemodynamic instability and encompasses the forms of clinical presentation shown in Table 4 .  \nAs an immediately life-threatening situation, high-risk PE requires an emergency diagnostic (upon suspicion) and therapeutic (upon confirmation or if the level of suspicion is sufficiently high) strategy, as outlined in section 7 . However, the absence of haemodynamic instability does not exclude beginning (and possibly progressing) RV dysfunction, and thus an elevated PE-related early risk. In this large population, further assessment (outlined in sections 5 and 7 ) is necessary to determine the level of risk and adjust management decisions accordingly.",
            "In addition to the clinical, imaging, and laboratory findings, which are directly linked to PE severity and PE-related early death, baseline parameters related to aggravating conditions and comorbidity are necessary to assess a patient's overall mortality risk and early outcome. Of the clinical scores integrating PE severity and comorbidity, the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) ( Table 7 ) is the one that has been most extensively validated to date. The principal strength of the PESI lies in the reliable identification of patients at low risk for 30 day mortality (PESI classes I and II). One randomized trial employed a low PESI as the principal inclusion criterion for home treatment of acute PE. 178  \nIn view of the complexity of the original PESI, which includes differently weighed variables, a simplified version (sPESI; Table 7) has been developed and validated. As with the original version of the PESI, the strength of the sPESI lies in the reliable identification of patients at low risk for 30 day mortality. The prognostic performance of the sPESI has been confirmed in observational cohort studies, although this index has not yet been prospectively used to guide therapeutic management of low-risk PE patients.  \nThe diagnosis of concomitant DVT has been identified as an adverse prognostic factor, being independently associated with death within the first 3 months after acute PE. In a meta-analysis investigating 8859 patients with PE, the presence of concomitant DVT was confirmed as a predictor of 30 day all-cause mortality (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.5 - 2.4), although it did not predict PE-related adverse outcomes at 90 days. Thus, concomitant DVT can be regarded as an indicator of significant comorbidity in acute PE.",

        "response": "The main early mortality risk categories used to classify pulmonary embolism (PE) severity and the risk of early (in-hospital or 30-day) death are as follows:\n\n1. High Risk:\n   - Presence of haemodynamic instability, defined as one of the following clinical presentations: cardiac arrest, obstructive shock (systolic BP <90 mmHg or need for vasopressors to maintain BP ≥90 mmHg despite adequate filling status, with end-organ hypoperfusion), or persistent hypotension (systolic BP <90 mmHg or a drop >40 mmHg lasting >15 minutes, not due to arrhythmia, hypovolaemia, or sepsis).\n   - Clinical parameters of PE severity and/or comorbidity: PESI class III-V or sPESI ≥1.\n   - Evidence of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) or computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA).\n   - Elevated cardiac troponin levels.\n   - In this category, haemodynamic instability combined with PE confirmation and/or RV dysfunction is sufficient for classification; PESI calculation or biomarker measurement is not necessary for immediate therapeutic decisions.\n\n2. Intermediate-High Risk:\n   - Absence of haemodynamic instability.\n   - Presence of clinical parameters indicating PE severity and/or comorbidity (PESI class III-V or sPESI ≥1).\n   - Evidence of RV dysfunction on TTE or CTPA.\n   - Elevated cardiac troponin levels.\n   - These patients require close monitoring to detect early haemodynamic decompensation and may need rescue reperfusion therapy if deterioration occurs.\n\n3. Intermediate-Low Risk:\n   - Absence of haemodynamic instability.\n   - Clinical parameters indicating PE severity and/or comorbidity (PESI class III-V or sPESI ≥1).\n   - One or none of the following positive: RV dysfunction on imaging or elevated cardiac troponin levels.\n   - These patients are typically hospitalized for monitoring.\n\n4. Low Risk:\n   - Absence of haemodynamic instability.\n   - Clinical parameters indicating low severity (PESI class I-II or sPESI = 0).\n   - No evidence of RV dysfunction on imaging.\n   - Normal cardiac troponin levels.\n   - These patients may be considered for early discharge and home treatment if no other contraindications exist.\n\nAdditional notes:\n- The PESI (Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index) and its simplified version (sPESI) are extensively validated clinical scores integrating PE severity and comorbidity to predict 30-day mortality risk.\n- RV dysfunction is assessed by prognostically relevant imaging findings on TTE or CTPA, including parameters such as RV enlargement, RV/LV ratio >1.0, McConnell sign, flattened interventricular septum, distended inferior vena cava with reduced collapsibility, decreased tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), and others.\n- Elevated cardiac biomarkers, particularly troponins, are important indicators of myocardial injury and correlate with increased early mortality risk.\n- The presence of concomitant deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is an adverse prognostic factor associated with increased 30-day all-cause mortality.\n- Risk stratification guides management decisions, including the need for emergency reperfusion in high-risk patients and monitoring intensity in intermediate-risk groups.\n\nIn summary, early mortality risk classification in acute PE is based primarily on haemodynamic status, clinical severity scores (PESI/sPESI), imaging evidence of RV dysfunction, and cardiac biomarker elevation, stratifying patients into high, intermediate-high, intermediate-low, and low-risk categories with corresponding implications for treatment and monitoring.

            "NOACs are small molecules that directly inhibit one activated coagulation factor, which is thrombin for dabigatran and factor Xa for apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban. The characteristics of NOACs used in the treatment of acute PE are summarized in Supplementary Data Table 6 . Owing to their predictable bioavailability and pharmacokinetics, NOACs can be given at fixed doses without routine laboratory monitoring. Compared with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), there are fewer interactions when NOACs are given concomitantly with other drugs. 259 In the phase III VTE trials, the dosages of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban were not reduced in patients with mild - moderate renal dysfunction (CrCl between 30 - 60 mL/min), whereas edoxaban was given at a 30 mg dose in these patients. Patients with CrCl <25 mL/min were excluded from the trials testing apixaban, whereas patients with CrCl <30 mL/min were excluded from those investigating rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran (Supplementary Data Table 8 ).  \nPhase III trials on the treatment of acute VTE (Supplementary Data Table 8 ), as well as those on extended treatment beyond the first 6 months (see section 8 ), demonstrated the non-inferiority of NOACs compared with the combination of LMWH with VKA for the prevention of symptomatic or lethal VTE recurrence, along with significantly reduced rates of major bleeding. 267 The different drug regimens tested in these trials are displayed in Supplementary Data Table 8 .Ina meta-analysis, the incidence rate of the primary efficacy outcome was 2.0% for NOAC-treated patients and 2.2% for VKA-treated patients [relative risk (RR) 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 - 1.05]. 268 Major bleeding occurred in 1.1% of NOAC-treated patients and 1.7% of VKAtreated patients for an RR of 0.60 (95% CI 0.41 - 0.88). Compared with VKA-treated patients, critical site major bleeding occurred less frequently in NOAC-treated patients (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.23 - 0.62); in particular, there was a significant reduction in intracranial bleeding (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.21 - 0.68) and in fatal bleeding (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.15 - 0.87) with NOACs compared with VKAs. 268  \nSuggestions for the anticoagulation management of PE in specific clinical situations, for which conclusive evidence is lacking, are presented in Supplementary Data Table 9 .  \nPractical guidance for clinicians regarding the handling of NOACs and the management of emergency situations related to their use are regularly updated by the European Heart Rhythm Association. 259",

        "response": "When oral anticoagulation is started in a patient with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) who is eligible for a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) such as apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban, the 2019 ESC guidelines recommend the use of a NOAC in preference to a vitamin K antagonist (VKA). This recommendation is classified as Class I with a Level of Evidence A.\n\nThis means that there is strong evidence and/or general agreement that the use of NOACs over VKAs is beneficial, useful, and effective in eligible patients with acute PE. The guidelines also specify that NOACs have advantages including predictable pharmacokinetics, fixed dosing without routine laboratory monitoring, and fewer drug interactions compared to VKAs.\n\nHowever, NOACs are not recommended in certain patient populations, including those with severe renal impairment, during pregnancy and lactation, and in patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (Class III, Level C).\n\nIn summary, for eligible patients with acute PE, the 2019 ESC guidelines strongly recommend initiating oral anticoagulation with NOACs rather than VKAs (Class I, Level A), except in specific contraindicated conditions."

Accordingly, clinical symptoms, and signs of overt RV failure and haemodynamic instability, indicate a high risk of early (in-hospital or 30 day) mortality. High-risk PE is defined by haemodynamic instability and encompasses the forms of clinical presentation shown in Table 4 .  \nAs an immediately life-threatening situation, high-risk PE requires an emergency diagnostic (upon suspicion) and therapeutic (upon confirmation or if the level of suspicion is sufficiently high) strategy, as outlined in section 7 . However, the absence of haemodynamic instability does not exclude beginning (and possibly progressing) RV dysfunction, and thus an elevated PE-related early risk. In this large population, further assessment (outlined in sections 5 and 7 ) is necessary to determine the level of risk and adjust management decisions accordingly.",

            "Hypoxaemia is one of the features of severe PE, and is mostly due to the mismatch between ventilation and perfusion. Administration of supplemental oxygen is indicated in patients with PE and SaO_2 <90%. Severe hypoxaemia/respiratory failure that is refractory to conventional oxygen supplementation could be explained by right-to-left shunt through a patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect. 67 Further oxygenation techniques should also be considered, including high-flow oxygen (i.e. a high-flow nasal cannula) 236,237 and mechanical ventilation (non-invasive or invasive) in cases of extreme instability (i.e. cardiac arrest), taking into consideration that correction of hypoxaemia will not be possible without simultaneous pulmonary reperfusion.  \nPatients with RV failure are frequently hypotensive or are highly susceptible to the development of severe hypotension during induction of anaesthesia, intubation, and positive-pressure ventilation. Consequently, intubation should be performed only if the patient is unable to tolerate or cope with non-invasive ventilation. When feasible, non-invasive ventilation or oxygenation through a high-flow nasal cannula should be preferred; if mechanical ventilation is used, care should be taken to limit its adverse haemodynamic effects. In particular, positive intrathoracic pressure induced by mechanical ventilation may reduce venous return and worsen low CO due to RV failure in patients with high-risk PE; therefore, positive end-expiratory pressure should be applied with caution. Tidal volumes of approximately 6 mL/kg lean body weight should be used in an attempt to keep the end-inspiratory plateau pressure <30 cm H_2_O. If intubation is needed, anaesthetic drugs more prone to cause hypotension should be avoided for induction.",
            "For most cases of acute PE without haemodynamic compromise, parenteral or oral anticoagulation (without reperfusion techniques) is adequate treatment. As shown in Figure 6 , normotensive patients with at least one indicator of elevated PE-related risk, or with aggravating conditions or comorbidity, should be hospitalized. In this group, patients with signs of RV dysfunction on echocardiography or CTPA (graphically presented in Figure 3 ), accompanied by a positive troponin test, should be monitored over the first hours or days due to the risk of early haemodynamic decompensation and circulatory collapse. 179 Routine primary reperfusion treatment, notably full-dose systemic thrombolysis, is not recommended, as the risk of potentially life-threatening bleeding complications appears too high for the expected benefits from this treatment. 179 Rescue thrombolytic therapy or, alternatively, surgical embolectomy or percutaneous catheter-directed treatment should be reserved for patients who develop signs of haemodynamic instability. In the PEITHO trial, the mean time between randomization and death or haemodynamic decompensation was 1.79 ± 1.60 days in the placebo (heparin-only) arm. 179 Therefore, it appears reasonable to leave patients with intermediate-high-risk PE on LMWH anticoagulation over the first 2 - 3 days and ensure that they remain stable before switching to oral anticoagulation. As mentioned in the previous section, the specifications concerning the increased initial dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban, or the minimum overall period of heparin anticoagulation before switching to dabigatran or edoxaban, must be followed.  \nSuggestions for the anticoagulation and overall management of acute PE in specific clinical situations, for which conclusive evidence is lacking, are presented in Supplementary Data Table 9 .",

        "response": "Supplemental oxygen is indicated in patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) who have hypoxaemia, specifically when arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) is less than 90%. Hypoxaemia in PE is primarily due to ventilation-perfusion mismatch. In cases of severe hypoxaemia or respiratory failure that does not respond to conventional oxygen supplementation, the cause may be a right-to-left shunt through a patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect. \n\nIn such severe cases, further oxygenation techniques should be considered, including high-flow oxygen delivery (e.g., high-flow nasal cannula) and mechanical ventilation (non-invasive or invasive) in patients with extreme instability, such as cardiac arrest. However, it is important to recognize that correction of hypoxaemia will not be achievable without simultaneous pulmonary reperfusion.\n\nPatients with right ventricular (RV) failure often present with hypotension or are at high risk of severe hypotension during anesthesia induction, intubation, and positive-pressure ventilation. Therefore, intubation should be reserved for patients who cannot tolerate or cope with non-invasive ventilation. When possible, non-invasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula oxygenation is preferred. If mechanical ventilation is necessary, care must be taken to minimize adverse hemodynamic effects, as positive intrathoracic pressure can reduce venous return and worsen low cardiac output due to RV failure. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) should be applied cautiously, and tidal volumes of approximately 6 mL/kg of lean body weight should be used to keep end-inspiratory plateau pressure below 30 cm H2O. Anesthetic drugs that are more likely to cause hypotension should be avoided during induction.\n\nIn summary, supplemental oxygen is indicated in PE patients with SaO2 <90%, with escalation to advanced oxygenation or ventilation strategies in cases of refractory hypoxaemia or respiratory failure, always considering the hemodynamic status and the need for pulmonary reperfusion. \n\nReference: ESC Guidelines on Pulmonary Embolism, section on oxygen supplementation and respiratory support."

Accordingly, clinical symptoms, and signs of overt RV failure and haemodynamic instability, indicate a high risk of early (in-hospital or 30 day) mortality. High-risk PE is defined by haemodynamic instability and encompasses the forms of clinical presentation shown in Table 4 .  \nAs an immediately life-threatening situation, high-risk PE requires an emergency diagnostic (upon suspicion) and therapeutic (upon confirmation or if the level of suspicion is sufficiently high) strategy, as outlined in section 7 . However, the absence of haemodynamic instability does not exclude beginning (and possibly progressing) RV dysfunction, and thus an elevated PE-related early risk. In this large population, further assessment (outlined in sections 5 and 7 ) is necessary to determine the level of risk and adjust management decisions accordingly.",

            "In hospitals in which V/Q scintigraphy is readily available, it is a valid option for patients with an elevated D-dimer and a contraindication to CTPA. Also, V/Q scintigraphy may be preferred over CTPA to avoid unnecessary radiation, particularly in younger patients and in female patients in whom thoracic CT might raise the lifetime risk of breast cancer. V/Q lung scintigraphy is diagnostic (with either normal- or high-probability findings) in ~ 30 - 50% of emergency ward patients with suspected PE. The proportion of diagnostic V/Q scans is higher in patients with a normal chest X-ray, and this might support the use of a V/Q scan as a first-line imaging test for PE in younger patients, depending on local availability. The number of patients with inconclusive findings may further be reduced by taking into account clinical probability. Thus, patients with a non-diagnostic lung scan and low clinical probability of PE have a low prevalence of confirmed PE, and the negative predictive value of this combination is further increased by the absence of a DVT on lower-limb CUS. If a highprobability lung scan is obtained from a patient with low clinical probability of PE, confirmation by other tests should be considered.",
            "The proposed strategy based on CTPA is shown in Figure 5 .Inpatients admitted to the emergency department, measurement of plasma Ddimer is the logical first step following the assessment of clinical probability and allows PE to be ruled out in GLYPH<C24> 30% of outpatients. D-dimer should not be measured in patients with a high clinical probability of PE, owing to a low negative predictive value in this population. 323 It is also less useful in hospitalized patients because the number that needs to be tested to obtain a clinically relevant negative result is high.  \nIn most centres, multidetector CTPA is the second-line test in patients with an elevated D-dimer level and the first-line test in patients with a high clinical probability of PE. CTPA is considered to be diagnostic of PE when it shows a clot at least at the segmental level of the pulmonary arterial tree. False-negative results of CTPA have been reported in patients with a high clinical probability of PE; 115 however, such discrepancies are infrequent and the 3 month thromboembolic risk was low in these patients. 171 Accordingly, both the necessity of performing further tests and the nature of these tests remain controversial in these clinical situations.",
            "Multidetector CTPA is the method of choice for imaging the pulmonary vasculature in patients with suspected PE. It allows adequate visualization of the pulmonary arteries down to the subsegmental level. The Prospective Investigation On Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis (PIOPED) II study observed a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 96% for (mainly four-detector) CTPA in PE diagnosis. 115 PIOPED II also highlighted the influence of pre-test clinical probability on the predictive value of multidetector CTPA. In patients with a low or intermediate clinical probability of PE, a negative CTPA had a high negative predictive value for PE (96 and 89%, respectively), but its negative predictive value was only 60% if the pre-test probability was high. Conversely, the positive predictive value of a positive CTPA was high (92 - 96%) in patients with an intermediate or high clinical probability, but much lower (58%) in patients with a low pre-test likelihood of PE. 115 Therefore, clinicians should consider further testing in case of discordance between clinical judgement and the CTPA result.  \nSeveral studies have provided evidence in favour of CTPA as a stand-alone imaging test for excluding PE. Taken together, the available data suggest that a negative CTPA result is an adequate criterion for the exclusion of PE in patients with low or intermediate clinical probability of PE. On the other hand, it remains controversial whether patients with a negative CTPA and a high clinical probability should be further investigated.  \nChronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a potentially fatal late sequela of PE, but pre-existing CTEPH should not be missed in patients investigated for suspected acute PE. Signs of preexisting CTEPH on CTPA are listed in Supplementary Data Table 2 ; the diagnosis and management of CTEPH is discussed in section 10 .  \nThe major strengths, weaknesses/limitations, and radiation issues related to the use of CTPA in the diagnosis of PE are summarized in Table 6 .",

            "As a general rule, early discharge of a patient with acute PE and continuation of anticoagulant treatment at home should be considered if three sets of criteria are fulfilled: (i) the risk of early PE-related death or serious complications is low ( section 5 ); (ii) there is no serious comorbidity or aggravating condition(s) (see section 5 )thatwould mandate hospitalization; and (iii) proper outpatient care and anticoagulant treatment can be provided, considering the patient's (anticipated) compliance, and the possibilities offered by the healthcare system and social infrastructure.  \nRandomized trials and prospective management cohort studies that investigated the feasibility and safety of early discharge, and home treatment, of PE adhered to these principles, even though slightly different criteria or combinations thereof were used to ensure the above three requirements.  \nThe Hestia exclusion criteria (Supplementary Data Table 12 ) represent a checklist of clinical parameters or questions that can be obtained/answered at the bedside. They integrate aspects of PE severity, comorbidity, and the feasibility of home treatment. If the answer to one or more of the questions is 'yes', then the patient cannot be discharged early. In a single-arm management trial that used these criteria to select candidates for home treatment, the 3 month rate of recurrent VTE was 2.0% (0.8 - 4.3%) in patients with acute PE who were discharged within 24 h. 317 In a subsequent non-inferiority trial that randomized 550 patients to direct discharge based on the Hestia criteria alone vs. additional NT-proBNP testing and discharge if levels were < \\_500 pg/mL, the primary outcome (30 day PE- or bleeding-related mortality, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or admission to an intensive care unit) was very low in both arms. The results suggest no incremental value of natriuretic-peptide testing in patients who are eligible for home treatment based on the Hestia criteria, although the study was not powered to exclude this possibility. 318  \nThe PESI and its simplified form, the sPESI ( Table 7 ), also integrate clinical parameters of PE severity and comorbidity to permit assessment of overall 30 day mortality. Compared with the Hestia criteria, the PESI is more standardized, but it contains a less-comprehensive list of aggravating conditions; moreover, the sPESI excludes all patients with cancer from the low-risk category (compare Table 7 with Supplementary Data Table 12 ). The PESI was not primarily developed as a tool to select candidates for home treatment, but it has been used-in combination with additional feasibility criteria-in a trial of 344 patients randomized to inpatient vs. outpatient treatment of PE. 178 One (0.6%) patient in each treatment group died within 90 days. 178  \nIn patients who were included in prospective cohort studies and treated at home, with or without a short hospitalization period, the 3 month rates of thromboembolic recurrence, major bleeding, and death were 1.75, 1.43, and 2.83%, respectively. 327  \nIn summary, the currently available evidence indicates that both the Hestia rule and the PESI or sPESI appear capable of reliably identifying patients who are (i) at low PE-related risk, and (ii) free of serious comorbidity. Consequently, either may be used for clinical triage according to local experience and preference. If a PESI- or sPESIbased approach is chosen, it must be combined with assessment of the feasibility of early discharge and home treatment; this assessment is already integrated into the Hestia criteria.  \nA more difficult decision related to immediate or early discharge is whether the exclusion of intermediate-risk PE on clinical grounds alone is adequate, or whether the assessment of RV dysfunction or myocardial injury (see section 5 )byanimagingtestora laboratory biomarker is necessary to provide maximal safety for the patient in this 'vulnerable' early period. A systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies suggested that the prognostic sensitivity is increased further when clinical criteria (e.g. PESI or sPESI) are combined with imaging findings, or laboratory biomarker levels. 234 A multicentre prospective management trial tested this hypothesis, investigating the efficacy and safety of early discharge, and ambulatory rivaroxaban treatment, in patients selected by clinical criteria and an absence of RV dysfunction.  \nOverall, ~ 20% of the screened unselected patients with PE were included. At the predefined interim analysis of 525 patients (50% of the planned population), the 3 month rate of symptomatic or fatal recurrent VTE was 0.6% (one-sided upper 99.6% CI 2.1%), permitting the early rejection of the null hypothesis and termination of the trial. Major bleeding occurred in six (1.2%) of the patients in the safety population. There were no PE-related deaths. 319 In view of the existing evidence-and taking into consideration (i) the catastrophic scenario of early death if a patient with acute PE is falsely judged to be at low risk on clinical grounds alone and discharged 'too early' (as described in a prematurely terminated trial), and (ii) the ease and minimal additional effort of assessing RV size and function at presentation by echocardiography, or on the CTPA performed to diagnose the PE event itself ( section 5 )-it is wise to exclude RV dysfunction and right heart thrombi if immediate or early (within the first 24 - 48 h) discharge of the patient is planned.",

            "Venous thromboembolism (VTE), clinically presenting as DVT or PE, is globally the third most frequent acute cardiovascular syndrome behind myocardial infarction and stroke. 2 In epidemiological studies, annual incidence rates for PE range from 39 - 115 per 100 000 population; for DVT, incidence rates range from 53 - 162 per 100 000 population. 3,4 Cross-sectional data show that the incidence of VTE is almost eight times higher in individuals aged > \\_80 years than in the fifth decade of life. 3 In parallel, longitudinal studies have revealed a rising tendency in annual PE incidence rates 4 - 7 over time. Together with the substantial hospitalassociated, preventable, and indirect annual expenditures for VTE (an estimated total of up to e 8.5 billion in the European Union), 8 these data demonstrate the importance of PE and DVT in ageing populations in Europe and other areas of the world. They further suggest that VTE will increasingly pose a burden on health systems worldwide in the years to come.  \nPE may cause < \\_300 000 deaths per year in the US, ranking high among the causes of cardiovascular mortality. 3 In six European countries with a total population of 454.4 million, more than 370 000 deaths were related to VTE in 2004, as estimated on the basis of an epidemiological model. 9 Of these patients, 34% died suddenly or within a few hours of the acute event, before therapy could be initiated or take effect. Of the other patients, death resulted from acute PE that was diagnosed after death in 59% and only 7% of patients who died early were correctly diagnosed with PE before death.  \nTime trend analyses in European, Asian, and North American populations suggest that case fatality rates of acute PE may be decreasing. 4 - 7,10,11 Increased use of more effective therapies and interventions, and possibly better adherence to guidelines, 12,13 has most likely exerted a significant positive effect on the prognosis of PE in recent years. However, there is also a tendency towards overdiagnosis of (subsegmental or even non-existent) PE in the modern era, 14 and this might in turn lead to a false drop in case fatality rates by inflating the denominator, i.e. the total number of PE cases.  \nFigure 1 summarizes the existing data on global trends in PE, highlighting increasing incidence rates in parallel with decreasing case fatality rates over an ~ 15 year period.  \nIn children, studies have reported an annual incidence of VTE of between 53 - 57 per 100 000 among hospitalized patients, 19,20 and between 1.4 - 4.9 per 100 000 in the community overall. 21,22",
            "The increased awareness of venous thromboembolic disease and the ever-increasing availability of non-invasive imaging tests, mainly computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography (CTPA), have generated a tendency for clinicians to suspect and initiate a diagnostic workup for PE more frequently than in the past. This changing attitude is illustrated by the rates of PE confirmation among patients undergoing diagnostic workup: these were as low as 5% in recent North American diagnostic studies, in sharp contrast to the approximately 50% prevalence reported back in the early 1980s. Therefore, it is critical that, when evaluating non-invasive diagnostic strategies for PE in the modern era, it is ensured that they are capable of safely excluding PE in contemporary patient populations with a rather low pre-test probability of the disease. Conversely, a positive test should have an adequate specificity to set the indication for anticoagulant treatment.",
            "Thrombolytic therapy leads to faster improvements in pulmonary obstruction, PAP, and PVR in patients with PE, compared with UFH alone; these improvements are accompanied by a reduction in RV dilation on echocardiography. 276 - 279 The greatest benefit is observed when treatment is initiated within 48 h of symptom onset, but thrombolysis can still be useful in patients who have had symptoms for 6 - 14 days. 280 Unsuccessful thrombolysis, as judged by persistent clinical instability and unchanged RV dysfunction on echocardiography after 36 h, has been reported in 8% of high-risk PE patients. 281  \nA meta-analysis of thrombolysis trials that included (but were not confined to) patients with high-risk PE, defined mainly as the presence of cardiogenic shock, indicated a significant reduction in the combined outcome of mortality and recurrent PE (Supplementary Data Table 10 ). This was achieved with a 9.9% rate of severe bleeding and a 1.7% rate of intracranial haemorrhage. 282  \nIn normotensive patients with intermediate-risk PE, defined as the presence of RV dysfunction and elevated troponin levels, the impact of thrombolytic treatment was investigated in the Pulmonary Embolism Thrombolysis (PEITHO) trial. Thrombolytic therapy was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of haemodynamic decompensation or collapse, but this was paralleled by an increased risk of severe extracranial and intracranial bleeding. In the PEITHO trial, 30 day death rates were low in both treatment groups, although meta-analyses have suggested a reduction in PErelated and overall mortality of as much as 50 - 60% following thrombolytic treatment in the intermediate-risk category (Supplementary Data Table 10 ).  \nThe approved regimens and doses of thrombolytic agents for PE, as well as the contraindications to this type of treatment, are shown in Table 10 . Accelerated i.v. administration of recombinant tissuetype plasminogen activator (rtPA; 100 mg over 2 h) is preferable to prolonged infusions of first-generation thrombolytic agents (streptokinase and urokinase). Preliminary reports on the efficacy and safety of reduced-dose rtPA 284,285 need confirmation by solid evidence before any recommendations can be made in this regard. UFH may be administered during continuous infusion of alteplase, but should be discontinued during infusion of streptokinase or urokinase. 65 Reteplase, 286 desmoteplase, 287 or tenecteplase 179,278,279 have also been investigated; at present, none of these agents are approved for use in acute PE.  \nIt remains unclear whether early thrombolysis for (intermediateor high-risk) acute PE has an impact on clinical symptoms, functional limitation, or CTEPH at long-term follow-up. A small randomized trial of 83 patients suggested that thrombolysis might improve functional capacity at 3 months compared with anticoagulation alone. In the PEITHO trial, 179 mild persisting symptoms, mainly dyspnoea, were present in 33% of the patients at long-term (at 41.6 ± 15.7 months) clinical follow-up. However, the majority of patients (85% in the tenecteplase arm and 96% in the placebo arm) had a low or intermediate probability-based on the ESC Guidelines definition of persisting or new-onset PH at echocardiographic followup. Consequently, the findings of this study do not support a role for thrombolysis with the aim of preventing long-term sequelae ( section 10 ) after intermediate-risk PE, although they are limited by the fact that clinical follow-up was available for only 62% of the study population.",

        "response": "The apparent increase in pulmonary embolism (PE) incidence over time alongside decreasing fatality rates can be explained by several factors based on current guideline data:\n\n1. Increased Awareness and Diagnostic Activity: There is heightened clinical suspicion and more frequent diagnostic workup for PE, largely due to increased awareness of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and the widespread availability of sensitive non-invasive imaging, particularly computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA). This leads to more cases being detected, including smaller or subsegmental emboli that might have been missed previously.\n\n2. Overdiagnosis: The modern era shows a tendency toward overdiagnosis of PE, including detection of subsegmental or even non-existent emboli. This inflates the denominator (total number of diagnosed PE cases), which can falsely lower the observed case fatality rate.\n\n3. Aging Population: The incidence of VTE, including PE, is significantly higher in older populations, and with aging demographics, the absolute number of cases is rising.\n\n4. Improved Therapeutic Interventions: Advances in treatment, including more effective anticoagulant therapies, thrombolytic regimens, and better adherence to clinical guidelines, have contributed to improved prognosis and reduced mortality from PE.\n\n5. Early Diagnosis and Treatment: Earlier detection allows initiation of therapy before fatal complications develop, reducing sudden deaths and deaths before diagnosis.\n\nIn summary, the rising incidence reflects both true increases in PE occurrence in aging populations and increased detection due to improved diagnostic practices, while the decreasing fatality rates are primarily due to better treatment and possibly the inclusion of less severe cases in the diagnosed population. This dual trend underscores the importance of careful clinical evaluation to balance the benefits of early diagnosis and treatment against the risks of overdiagnosis and overtreatment."

A multinational prospective management study evaluated a previously validated age-adjusted cut-off (age ~ 10 m g/L, for patients aged >50 years) in a cohort of 3346 patients. 106 Patients with a normal ageadjusted D-dimer value did not undergo CTPA; they were left untreated and followed for a 3 month period.

            "In addition to the clinical, imaging, and laboratory findings, which are directly linked to PE severity and PE-related early death, baseline parameters related to aggravating conditions and comorbidity are necessary to assess a patient's overall mortality risk and early outcome. Of the clinical scores integrating PE severity and comorbidity, the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) ( Table 7 ) is the one that has been most extensively validated to date. The principal strength of the PESI lies in the reliable identification of patients at low risk for 30 day mortality (PESI classes I and II). One randomized trial employed a low PESI as the principal inclusion criterion for home treatment of acute PE. 178  \nIn view of the complexity of the original PESI, which includes differently weighed variables, a simplified version (sPESI; Table 7) has been developed and validated. As with the original version of the PESI, the strength of the sPESI lies in the reliable identification of patients at low risk for 30 day mortality. The prognostic performance of the sPESI has been confirmed in observational cohort studies, although this index has not yet been prospectively used to guide therapeutic management of low-risk PE patients.  \nThe diagnosis of concomitant DVT has been identified as an adverse prognostic factor, being independently associated with death within the first 3 months after acute PE. In a meta-analysis investigating 8859 patients with PE, the presence of concomitant DVT was confirmed as a predictor of 30 day all-cause mortality (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.5 - 2.4), although it did not predict PE-related adverse outcomes at 90 days. Thus, concomitant DVT can be regarded as an indicator of significant comorbidity in acute PE.",
            "Various combinations of clinical assessments, plasma D-dimer measurements, and imaging tests have been proposed and validated for PE diagnosis. These strategies have been tested in patients presenting with suspected PE in the emergency department or during their hospital stay, and more recently in the primary care setting. Withholding of anticoagulation without adherence to evidence-based diagnostic strategies was associated with a significant increase in the number of VTE episodes and sudden cardiac death at 3 month follow-up. The most straightforward diagnostic algorithms for suspected PE-with and without haemodynamic instability-are presented in Figures 4 and 5 , respectively. However, it is recognized that the diagnostic approach for suspected PE may vary, depending on the availability of, and expertise in, specific tests in various hospitals and clinical settings.",

        "response": "Pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosis in elderly patients with comorbidities is more challenging primarily due to the decreased specificity of D-dimer testing with advancing age. In patients over 80 years, the specificity of D-dimer for suspected PE drops to approximately 10%, leading to a high rate of false positives. Although age-adjusted D-dimer cutoffs (e.g., age × 10 µg/L for patients over 50 years) can improve diagnostic performance and reduce unnecessary imaging, the interpretation remains complex in this population.\n\nAdditionally, elderly patients often have multiple comorbidities that can mimic or mask PE symptoms, complicating clinical probability assessment. Comorbid conditions also influence baseline parameters and overall mortality risk, which must be integrated into the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation using tools like the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) or its simplified version (sPESI). These scores help identify low-risk patients but require careful application in the elderly with comorbidities.\n\nFurthermore, clinical presentation in elderly patients may be atypical or less specific, and the presence of concomitant deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is an adverse prognostic factor, may not always be evident. Imaging and laboratory strategies must be carefully selected and interpreted, considering the limited utility of D-dimer in hospitalized patients and the need for appropriate imaging such as computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA).\n\nIn summary, the difficulty in diagnosing PE in elderly patients with comorbidities arises from the reduced specificity of D-dimer testing with age, the complexity added by comorbid conditions affecting clinical assessment and prognosis, and the potential atypical presentation of PE, necessitating cautious and tailored diagnostic approaches."

            "Multidetector CTPA is the method of choice for imaging the pulmonary vasculature in patients with suspected PE. It allows adequate visualization of the pulmonary arteries down to the subsegmental level. The Prospective Investigation On Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis (PIOPED) II study observed a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 96% for (mainly four-detector) CTPA in PE diagnosis. 115 PIOPED II also highlighted the influence of pre-test clinical probability on the predictive value of multidetector CTPA. In patients with a low or intermediate clinical probability of PE, a negative CTPA had a high negative predictive value for PE (96 and 89%, respectively), but its negative predictive value was only 60% if the pre-test probability was high. Conversely, the positive predictive value of a positive CTPA was high (92 - 96%) in patients with an intermediate or high clinical probability, but much lower (58%) in patients with a low pre-test likelihood of PE. 115 Therefore, clinicians should consider further testing in case of discordance between clinical judgement and the CTPA result.  \nSeveral studies have provided evidence in favour of CTPA as a stand-alone imaging test for excluding PE. Taken together, the available data suggest that a negative CTPA result is an adequate criterion for the exclusion of PE in patients with low or intermediate clinical probability of PE. On the other hand, it remains controversial whether patients with a negative CTPA and a high clinical probability should be further investigated.  \nChronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a potentially fatal late sequela of PE, but pre-existing CTEPH should not be missed in patients investigated for suspected acute PE. Signs of preexisting CTEPH on CTPA are listed in Supplementary Data Table 2 ; the diagnosis and management of CTEPH is discussed in section 10 .  \nThe major strengths, weaknesses/limitations, and radiation issues related to the use of CTPA in the diagnosis of PE are summarized in Table 6 .",

        "response": "Computed Tomographic Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is highly sensitive and specific for diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE), particularly at the segmental or more proximal levels of the pulmonary arterial tree. However, CTPA is not always sufficient to exclude PE in all patients due to several important limitations:\n\n1. Influence of Pre-test Clinical Probability: The negative predictive value of CTPA varies with the clinical probability of PE. In patients with low or intermediate clinical probability, a negative CTPA has a high negative predictive value (96% and 89%, respectively), making it reliable to exclude PE. However, in patients with a high clinical probability of PE, the negative predictive value drops significantly to about 60%. This means that a negative CTPA in high-probability patients does not reliably exclude PE, and further testing may be warranted.\n\n2. False-Negative Results: Although infrequent, false-negative CTPA results have been reported, especially in patients with high clinical suspicion of PE. This may be due to small or subsegmental emboli that are difficult to visualize or technical limitations.\n\n3. Clinical Discordance: When there is discordance between clinical judgment and CTPA results—such as a high clinical probability but negative CTPA—additional imaging or diagnostic tests should be considered before withholding PE-specific treatment.\n\n4. Technical and Patient-Related Limitations: CTPA may be limited by factors such as suboptimal imaging quality, patient movement, or contraindications to contrast media (e.g., iodine allergy, renal failure). Additionally, the clinical relevance of isolated subsegmental PE detected by CTPA remains uncertain.\n\n5. Radiation and Contrast Exposure: While not directly related to diagnostic sufficiency, the risks associated with radiation exposure and iodine contrast limit the use of CTPA in certain populations, potentially affecting the choice and timing of diagnostic strategies.\n\nIn summary, despite its high sensitivity and specificity, CTPA's ability to exclude PE is limited in patients with high clinical probability due to a lower negative predictive value and the possibility of false negatives. Clinical judgment remains paramount, and further testing should be considered when there is discordance between clinical assessment and CTPA findings."

            "The proposed strategy is shown in Figure 4 . The clinical probability is usually high and the differential diagnosis includes cardiac tamponade, acute coronary syndrome, aortic dissection, acute valvular dysfunction, and hypovolaemia. The most useful initial test in this situation is bedside TTE, which will yield evidence of acute RV dysfunction if acute PE is the cause of the patient's haemodynamic decompensation. In a highly unstable patient, echocardiographic evidence of RV dysfunction is sufficient to prompt immediate reperfusion without further testing. This decision may be strengthened by the (rare) visualization of right heart thrombi. 155,157,321,322 Ancillary bedside imaging tests include TOE, which may allow direct visualization of thrombi in the pulmonary artery and its main branches, especially in patients with RV dysfunction. TOE should be cautiously performed in hypoxaemic patients. Moreover, bedside CUS can detect proximal DVT. As soon as the patient is stabilized using supportive treatment, final confirmation of the diagnosis by CT angiography should be sought.  \nFor unstable patients admitted directly to the catheterization laboratory with suspected acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary angiography may be considered as a diagnostic procedure after the acute coronary syndrome has been excluded, provided that PE is a probable diagnostic alternative and particularly if percutaneous catheterdirected treatment is a therapeutic option.",

Nevertheless, echocardiographic assessment of the morphology and function of the RV is widely recognized as a valuable tool for the prognostic assessment of normotensive patients with acute PE in clinical practice.  \nIn addition to RV dysfunction, echocardiography can identify rightto-left shunt through a patent foramen ovale and the presence of right heart thrombi, both of which are associated with increased  \nmortality in patients with acute PE.

            "The proposed strategy is shown in Figure 4 . The clinical probability is usually high and the differential diagnosis includes cardiac tamponade, acute coronary syndrome, aortic dissection, acute valvular dysfunction, and hypovolaemia. The most useful initial test in this situation is bedside TTE, which will yield evidence of acute RV dysfunction if acute PE is the cause of the patient's haemodynamic decompensation. In a highly unstable patient, echocardiographic evidence of RV dysfunction is sufficient to prompt immediate reperfusion without further testing. This decision may be strengthened by the (rare) visualization of right heart thrombi. 155,157,321,322 Ancillary bedside imaging tests include TOE, which may allow direct visualization of thrombi in the pulmonary artery and its main branches, especially in patients with RV dysfunction. TOE should be cautiously performed in hypoxaemic patients. Moreover, bedside CUS can detect proximal DVT. As soon as the patient is stabilized using supportive treatment, final confirmation of the diagnosis by CT angiography should be sought.  \nFor unstable patients admitted directly to the catheterization laboratory with suspected acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary angiography may be considered as a diagnostic procedure after the acute coronary syndrome has been excluded, provided that PE is a probable diagnostic alternative and particularly if percutaneous catheterdirected treatment is a therapeutic option.",

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have suggested that RV dysfunction on echocardiography is associated with an elevated risk of short-term mortality in patients who appear haemodynamically stable at presentation, 180,181 but its overall positive predictive value for PE-related death was low (<10%) in a metaanalysis. 180 This weakness is partly related to the fact that echocardiographic parameters have proved difficult to standardize. Nevertheless, echocardiographic assessment of the morphology and function of the RV is widely recognized as a valuable tool for the prognostic assessment of normotensive patients with acute PE in clinical practice.  \nIn addition to RV dysfunction, echocardiography can identify rightto-left shunt through a patent foramen ovale and the presence of right heart thrombi, both of which are associated with increased  \nmortality in patients with acute PE.

High-risk PE is defined by haemodynamic instability and encompasses the forms of clinical presentation shown in Table 4 .  \nAs an immediately life-threatening situation, high-risk PE requires an emergency diagnostic (upon suspicion) and therapeutic (upon confirmation or if the level of suspicion is sufficiently high) strategy, as outlined in section 7 . However, the absence of haemodynamic instability does not exclude beginning (and possibly progressing) RV dysfunction, and thus an elevated PE-related early risk. In this large population, further assessment (outlined in sections 5 and 7 ) is necessary to determine the level of risk and adjust management decisions accordingly.",

        "response": "In the initial evaluation of suspected high-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) presenting with hemodynamic instability, bedside transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) plays a critical role. It is the most useful initial test to detect acute right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, which is a hallmark of high-risk PE and a key determinant of clinical severity and prognosis.\n\nEchocardiographic findings indicative of RV dysfunction include an RV/left ventricle (LV) diameter ratio >1.0, decreased tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE <16 mm), and other parameters of RV pressure overload (e.g., McConnell sign, flattened interventricular septum). The presence of RV dysfunction on echocardiography in a patient with suspected high-risk PE and hemodynamic compromise strongly supports the diagnosis.\n\nThe influence of echocardiography on immediate management is as follows:\n\n1. If RV dysfunction is absent, alternative causes of shock or instability should be sought.\n2. If RV dysfunction is present, computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) should be performed immediately to confirm the diagnosis.\n3. If CTPA is not available or feasible due to the patient's critical condition, echocardiographic evidence of RV dysfunction alone is sufficient to confirm high-risk PE and justify emergency reperfusion therapy without delay.\n4. Echocardiography may also identify right heart thrombi and right-to-left shunts through a patent foramen ovale, which are associated with increased mortality and may influence management decisions.\n5. Ancillary bedside imaging such as transesophageal echocardiography (TOE) can directly visualize emboli in the pulmonary artery and its branches, especially in patients with RV dysfunction, but should be used cautiously in hypoxemic patients.\n6. Bilateral venous compression ultrasonography can be used adjunctively to detect deep vein thrombosis, supporting the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism.\n\nIn summary, bedside echocardiography is essential in the rapid assessment of suspected high-risk PE with hemodynamic instability. It guides immediate management by confirming RV dysfunction, which, in the absence of other causes, justifies urgent reperfusion therapy even before confirmatory imaging by CTPA can be obtained. This approach prioritizes timely intervention in a life-threatening situation."

            "Acute PE may lead to RV pressure overload and dysfunction, which can be detected by echocardiography. Given the peculiar geometry of the RV, there is no individual echocardiographic parameter that provides fast and reliable information on RV size or function. This is why echocardiographic criteria for the diagnosis of PE have differed between studies. Because of the reported negative predictive value of 40 - 50%, a negative result cannot exclude PE. 124,142,143 On the other hand, signs of RV overload or dysfunction may also be found in the absence of acute PE, and may be due to concomitant cardiac or respiratory disease.  \nEchocardiographic findings of RV overload and/or dysfunction are graphically presented in Figure 3 . RV dilation is found in > \\_25% of patients with PE on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and is useful for risk stratification of the disease. 145 More specific echocardiographic findings were reported to retain a high positive predictive value for PE even in the presence of pre-existing cardiorespiratory disease. Thus, the combination of a pulmonary ejection acceleration time (measured in the RV outflow tract) <60 ms with a peak systolic tricuspid valve gradient <60 mmHg ('60/60' sign), or with depressed contractility of the RV free wall compared to the 'echocardiographic' RV apex (McConnell sign), is suggestive of PE. 146 However, these findings are present in only ~ 12 and 20% of unselected PE patients, respectively. 145 Detection of echocardiographic signs of RV pressure overload helps to distinguish acute PE from RV free wall hypokinesia or akinesia due to RV infarction, which may mimic the McConnell sign. 147 It should be noted that in ~ 10% of PE patients, echocardiography can show potentially misleading incidental findings such as significant LV systolic dysfunction or valvular heart disease. 145 Decreased tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) may also be present in PE patients. 148,149 Echocardiographic parameters of RV function derived from Doppler tissue imaging and wall strain assessment may also be affected by the presence of acute PE ( Figure 3 ). However, they probably have low sensitivity as stand-alone findings, as they were reported to be normal in haemodynamically stable patients despite the presence of PE.  \nEchocardiographic examination is not mandatory as part of the routine diagnostic workup in haemodynamically stable patients with suspected PE, 124 although it may be useful in the differential diagnosis of acute dyspnoea. This is in contrast to suspected high-risk PE, in which the absence of echocardiographic signs of RV overload or dysfunction practically excludes PE as the cause of haemodynamic instability. In the latter case, echocardiography may be of further help in the differential diagnosis of the cause of shock, by detecting pericardial tamponade, acute valvular dysfunction, severe global or regional LV dysfunction, aortic dissection, or hypovolaemia. 152 Conversely, in a haemodynamically compromised patient with suspected PE, unequivocal signs of RV pressure overload, especially with more specific echocardiographic findings (60/60 sign, McConnell sign, or rightheart thrombi), justify emergency reperfusion treatment for PE if immediate CT angiography is not feasible in a patient with high clinical probability and no other obvious causes for RV pressure overload.  \nMobile right-heart thrombi are detected by TTE or transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE), or by CT angiography, in <4% of unselected patients with PE. 153 - 155 Their prevalence may reach 18% among PE patients in the intensive care setting. 156 Mobile right-heart thrombi essentially confirm the diagnosis of PE and are associated with high early mortality, especially in patients with RV dysfunction.  \nIn some patients with suspected acute PE, echocardiography may detect increased RV wall thickness or tricuspid insufficiency jet velocity beyond values compatible with acute RV pressure overload (>3.8 m/s or a tricuspid valve peak systolic gradient >60 mmHg). In these cases, chronic thromboembolic (or other) pulmonary hypertension (PH) should be included in the differential diagnosis.",

            "The combination of symptoms and clinical findings with the presence of predisposing factors for VTE allows the classification of patients with suspected PE into distinct categories of clinical or pre-test probability, which correspond to an increasing actual prevalence of confirmed PE. This pre-test assessment can be done either by implicit (empirical) clinical judgement or by using prediction rules. As the post-test (i.e. after an imaging test) probability of PE depends not only on the characteristics of the diagnostic test itself but also on the pretest probability, this is a key step in all diagnostic algorithms for PE.  \nThe value of empirical clinical judgement has been confirmed in several large series. Clinical judgement usually includes commonplace tests such as chest X-rays and electrocardiograms for differential diagnosis. However, as clinical judgement lacks standardization, several explicit clinical prediction rules have been developed. Of these, the most frequently used prediction rules are the revised Geneva rule ( Table 5 ) and the Wells rule (see Supplementary Data Table 1). Both prediction rules have been simplified in an attempt to increase their adoption into clinical practice; the simplified versions have been externally validated.  \nRegardless of the score used, the proportion of patients with confirmed PE can be expected to be ~ 10% in the low-probability category, 30% in the moderate-probability category, and 65% in the highprobability category. When the two-level classification is used, the proportion of patients with confirmed PE is ~ 12% in the PE-unlikely category and 30% in the PE-likely category.

Clinical Probability Assessment:\n- Use either clinical judgment or validated prediction rules (e.g., Wells score, revised Geneva score) to classify patients into categories of clinical probability:\n  - Three-level scheme: Low, intermediate, or high clinical probability.\n  - Two-level scheme: PE unlikely or PE likely.\n\n2. D-dimer Testing:\n- For patients with low or intermediate clinical probability (or PE unlikely classification), a negative D-dimer test allows safe exclusion of PE without anticoagulation.\n- When using a moderately sensitive D-dimer assay, testing should be restricted to patients with low clinical probability or PE unlikely.\n- Highly sensitive D-dimer assays may also be used in patients with intermediate clinical probability due to higher sensitivity and negative predictive value.\n- Note: D-dimer testing has limited utility in hospitalized patients suspected of PE.\n\n3. Imaging (CT Pulmonary Angiography, CTPA):\n- In patients with high clinical probability or PE likely classification, CTPA is performed directly.\n- If CTPA is negative in patients with low/intermediate clinical probability and positive D-dimer, PE can be safely excluded without anticoagulation.\n- In patients with high clinical probability and negative CTPA, further imaging may be considered before withholding anticoagulation.\n\n4. Specific Algorithm Example (YEARS rule):\n- PE can be excluded without anticoagulation in patients with no clinical items (signs of DVT, hemoptysis, PE more likely than alternative diagnosis) and D-dimer <1000 ng/mL.\n- Also, in patients with one or more clinical items and D-dimer <500 ng/mL.\n- All other patients undergo CTPA.\n- This approach safely excluded PE in 85% of patients without anticoagulation, with a low rate of subsequent VTE events.\n\nSummary:\nSafe exclusion of PE without anticoagulation is achieved when patients have low or intermediate clinical probability (or PE unlikely) combined with a negative D-dimer test, or when CTPA is negative in these patients. In high clinical probability patients, a negative CTPA may require further imaging before withholding treatment. The YEARS algorithm provides a validated approach combining clinical criteria and D-dimer thresholds to safely exclude PE without anticoagulation."

            "The classification of PE severity and the risk of early (in-hospital or 30 day) death is summarized in Table 8 . Risk assessment of acute PE begins upon suspicion of the disease and initiation of the diagnostic workup. At this early stage, it is critical to identify patients with (suspected) high-risk PE. This clinical setting necessitates an emergency diagnostic algorithm ( Figure 4 ) and immediate referral for reperfusion treatment, as explained in section 7 , and displayed in Figure 6 and Supplementary Data Figure 1 . Testing for laboratory biomarkers such as cardiac troponins or natriuretic peptides is not necessary for immediate therapeutic decisions in patients with high-risk PE.  \nIn the absence of haemodynamic instability at presentation, further risk stratification of PE is recommended, as it has implications for early discharge vs. hospitalization or monitoring of the patient (explained in section 7 ). Table 8 provides an overview of the clinical, imaging, and laboratory parameters used to distinguish intermediateand low-risk PE. The PESI is-in its original or simplified form-the most extensively validated and most broadly used clinical score to date, as it integrates baseline indicators of the severity of the acute PE episode with aggravating conditions and the comorbidity of the patient. Overall, a PESI of class I - II or an sPESI of 0 is a reliable predictor of low-risk PE.  \nIn addition to clinical parameters, patients in the intermediate-risk group who display evidence of both RV dysfunction (on echocardiography or CTPA) and elevated cardiac biomarker levels in the circulation (particularly a positive cardiac troponin test) are classified into the intermediate-high-risk category. As will be discussed in more detail in section 7 , close monitoring is recommended in these cases to permit the early detection of haemodynamic decompensation or collapse, and consequently the need for rescue reperfusion therapy. 179 Patients in whom the RV appears normal on echocardiography or CTPA, and/or who have normal cardiac biomarker levels, belong to the intermediate-low-risk category. As an alternative approach, use of further prognostic scores combining clinical, imaging, and laboratory parameters may be considered to semi-quantitatively assess the severity of the PE episode, and distinguish intermediate-high-risk and intermediate-low-risk PE. Supplementary Data Table 4 lists the scores most frequently investigated for this purpose in observational (cohort) studies; however, none of them has been used in RCTs to date.  \nA recent meta-analysis included 21 cohort studies with a total of 3295 patients with 'low-risk' PE based on a PESI of I - II or an sPESI of 0. 234 Overall, 34% (95% CI 30 - 39%) of them were reported to have signs of RV dysfunction on echocardiography or CTPA. Data on early mortality were provided in seven studies (1597 patients) and revealed an OR of 4.19 (95% CI 1.39 - 12.58) for death from any cause in the presence of RV dysfunction; elevated cardiac troponin levels were associated with a comparable magnitude of risk elevation. 234 Early all-cause mortality rates (1.8% for RV dysfunction and 3.8% for elevated troponin levels) were in the lower range of those previously reported for patients with intermediate-risk PE. 235 Until the clinical implications of such discrepancies are clarified, patients with signs of RV dysfunction or elevated cardiac biomarkers, despite a low PESI or an sPESI of 0, should be classified into the intermediate-low-risk category.",
            "In patients who present without haemodynamic instability, individual baseline findings may not suffice to determine and further classify PE severity and PE-related early risk when used as stand-alone parameters. As a result, various combinations of the clinical, imaging, and laboratory parameters described above have been used to build prognostic scores, which permit a (semi)quantitative assessment of early PE-related risk of death. Of these, the Bova 218 - 221 and the HFABP (or high-sensitivity troponin T), Syncope, Tachycardia (FAST) scores 219,222,223 have been validated in cohort studies (see Supplementary Data Table 4 ). However, their implications for patient management remain unclear. To date, only a combination of RV dysfunction on an echocardiogram (or CTPA) with a positive cardiac troponin test has directly been tested as a guide for early therapeutic decisions (anticoagulation plus reperfusion treatment vs. anticoagulation alone) in a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) of PE patients presenting without haemodynamic instability. 224",
            "Risk stratification of patients with acute PE is mandatory for determining the appropriate therapeutic management approach. As described in section 3.3 , initial risk stratification is based on clinical symptoms and signs of haemodynamic instability ( Table 4 ), which indicate a high risk of early death. In the large remaining group of patients with PE who present without haemodynamic instability, further (advanced) risk stratification requires the assessment of two sets of prognostic criteria: (i) clinical, imaging, and laboratory indicators of PE severity, mostly related to the presence of RV dysfunction; and (ii) presence of comorbidity and any other aggravating conditions that may adversely affect early prognosis.",

        "response": "Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction in hemodynamically stable patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) plays a critical role in the classification of PE severity and the stratification of early (in-hospital or 30-day) mortality risk. In patients without hemodynamic instability, the presence of RV dysfunction, assessed by imaging modalities such as transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) or computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA), combined with elevated cardiac biomarkers (particularly cardiac troponins), identifies an intermediate-high-risk category. This group requires close monitoring due to the increased risk of hemodynamic decompensation and potential need for rescue reperfusion therapy.\n\nThe classification framework is as follows:\n\n1. High-risk PE: Characterized by hemodynamic instability (e.g., cardiac arrest, obstructive shock, or persistent hypotension) with evidence of RV dysfunction. Immediate reperfusion treatment is indicated without the need for further biomarker testing.\n\n2. Intermediate-risk PE (hemodynamically stable):\n   - Intermediate-high risk: Patients with clinical severity indicators (e.g., PESI class III-V or sPESI ≥1), RV dysfunction on TTE or CTPA, and elevated cardiac troponin levels.\n   - Intermediate-low risk: Patients with clinical severity indicators but only one or none of the following: RV dysfunction or elevated cardiac biomarkers.\n\n3. Low-risk PE: Absence of clinical severity indicators, RV dysfunction, and elevated biomarkers.\n\nNotably, even patients classified as low-risk by clinical scores (PESI I-II or sPESI 0) may have RV dysfunction on imaging, which is associated with a fourfold increase in the odds of early death, although their absolute mortality remains low. Such patients should be reclassified as intermediate-low risk until further evidence clarifies management implications.\n\nAssessment tools used to evaluate RV dysfunction include:\n\n- Imaging:\n  - Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE): Parameters such as RV enlargement, RV/LV ratio >1.0, McConnell sign, flattened interventricular septum, inferior vena cava dilation with reduced collapsibility, decreased tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE <16 mm), and reduced tricuspid annular peak systolic velocity (S' <9.5 cm/s).\n  - Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA): RV enlargement and other signs of RV pressure overload.\n\n- Laboratory biomarkers:\n  - Cardiac troponins (high-sensitivity troponin T or I).\n  - Natriuretic peptides (e.g., NT-proBNP), heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP), and copeptin may provide additional prognostic information but are not yet used to guide treatment decisions in randomized controlled trials.\n\nPrognostic scores integrating clinical, imaging, and laboratory parameters, such as the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) and its simplified version (sPESI), are widely validated for risk stratification. Other scores like Bova and FAST incorporate RV dysfunction and biomarkers but have less clear implications for management.\n\nIn summary, RV dysfunction in hemodynamically stable PE patients is a key determinant for intermediate-risk classification and guides the intensity of monitoring and therapeutic decisions. It is assessed primarily by echocardiography or CTPA, complemented by cardiac biomarker measurement, and integrated into validated clinical risk scores to stratify early mortality risk."

Testing for laboratory biomarkers such as cardiac troponins or natriuretic peptides is not necessary for immediate therapeutic decisions in patients with high-risk PE.  \nIn the absence of haemodynamic instability at presentation, further risk stratification of PE is recommended, as it has implications for early discharge vs. hospitalization or monitoring of the patient (explained in section 7 ). Table 8 provides an overview of the clinical, imaging, and laboratory parameters used to distinguish intermediateand low-risk PE. The PESI is-in its original or simplified form-the most extensively validated and most broadly used clinical score to date, as it integrates baseline indicators of the severity of the acute PE episode with aggravating conditions and the comorbidity of the patient. Overall, a PESI of class I - II or an sPESI of 0 is a reliable predictor of low-risk PE.  \nIn addition to clinical parameters, patients in the intermediate-risk group who display evidence of both RV dysfunction (on echocardiography or CTPA) and elevated cardiac biomarker levels in the circulation (particularly a positive cardiac troponin test) are classified into the intermediate-high-risk category. As will be discussed in more detail in section 7 , close monitoring is recommended in these cases to permit the early detection of haemodynamic decompensation or collapse, and consequently the need for rescue reperfusion therapy. 179 Patients in whom the RV appears normal on echocardiography or CTPA, and/or who have normal cardiac biomarker levels, belong to the intermediate-low-risk category. As an alternative approach, use of further prognostic scores combining clinical, imaging, and laboratory parameters may be considered to semi-quantitatively assess the severity of the PE episode, and distinguish intermediate-high-risk and intermediate-low-risk PE. Supplementary Data Table 4 lists the scores most frequently investigated for this purpose in observational (cohort) studies; however, none of them has been used in RCTs to date.  \nA recent meta-analysis included 21 cohort studies with a total of 3295 patients with 'low-risk' PE based on a PESI of I - II or an sPESI of 0. 234 Overall, 34% (95% CI 30 - 39%) of them were reported to have signs of RV dysfunction on echocardiography or CTPA. Data on early mortality were provided in seven studies (1597 patients) and revealed an OR of 4.19 (95% CI 1.39 - 12.58) for death from any cause in the presence of RV dysfunction; elevated cardiac troponin levels were associated with a comparable magnitude of risk elevation. 234 Early all-cause mortality rates (1.8% for RV dysfunction and 3.8% for elevated troponin levels) were in the lower range of those previously reported for patients with intermediate-risk PE. 235 Until the clinical implications of such discrepancies are clarified, patients with signs of RV dysfunction or elevated cardiac biomarkers, despite a low PESI or an sPESI of 0, should be classified into the intermediate-low-risk category.",

            "Elevated plasma troponin concentrations on admission may be associated with a worse prognosis in the acute phase of PE. Cardiac troponin I or T elevation are defined as concentrations above the normal limits, and thresholds depend on the assay used; an overview of the cut-off values has been provided by a meta-analysis. 194 Of patients with acute PE, between 30 (using conventional assays) 194,195 and 60% (using highsensitivity assays)have elevated cardiac troponin I or T concentrations. A meta-analysis showed that elevated troponin concentrations were associated with an increased risk of mortality, both in unselected patients (OR 5.2, 95% CI 3.3 - 8.4) and in those who were haemodynamically stable at presentation (OR 5.9, 95% CI 2.7 - 13.0).  \nOn their own, increased circulating levels of cardiac troponins have relatively low specificity and positive predictive value for early mortality in normotensive patients with acute PE. However, when interpreted in combination with clinical and imaging findings, they may improve the identification of an elevated PE-related risk and the further prognostic stratification of such patients (Supplementary Data Table 4 ). At the other end of the severity spectrum, high-sensitivity troponin assays possess a high negative predictive value in the setting of acute PE. 197 For example, in a prospective multicentre cohort of 526 normotensive patients, high-sensitivity troponin T concentrations <14 pg/mL had a negative predictive value of 98% for excluding an adverse in-hospital clinical outcome. 63 Age-adjusted high-sensitivity troponin T cutoff values (> \\_14 pg/mL for patients aged <75 years and > \\_45 pg/mL for those > \\_75 years) may further improve the negative predictive value of this biomarker. 196  \nHeart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP), an early and sensitive marker of myocardial injury, provides prognostic information in acute PE, both in unselected and normotensive patients. In a meta-analysis investigating 1680 patients with PE, H-FABP concentrations > \\_6 ng/mL were associated with an adverse short-term outcome (OR 17.7, 95% CI 6.0 - 51.9) and all-cause mortality (OR 32.9, 95% CI 8.8 - 123.2). 202",

        "response": "Elevated cardiac biomarkers, particularly cardiac troponins, play a significant role in the risk stratification of pulmonary embolism (PE) severity and early mortality risk, especially when clinical scores such as PESI or sPESI indicate low risk. According to the guidelines:\n\n1. In patients without hemodynamic instability and with low-risk clinical scores (PESI class I-II or sPESI of 0), the presence of elevated cardiac biomarkers (e.g., positive cardiac troponin test) and/or signs of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction on imaging (echocardiography or CTPA) reclassifies these patients from low risk to an intermediate-low-risk category. This reclassification is important because it identifies patients who may have a higher risk of early (in-hospital or 30-day) death than suggested by clinical scores alone.\n\n2. Elevated cardiac troponin levels in normotensive patients with acute PE are associated with an increased risk of mortality (odds ratio approximately 4 to 5), comparable to the risk conferred by RV dysfunction. However, elevated troponins alone have relatively low specificity and positive predictive value for early mortality, so their interpretation should be combined with clinical and imaging findings.\n\n3. Patients with low PESI or sPESI scores but elevated cardiac biomarkers or RV dysfunction should be monitored more closely, as they may be at risk for hemodynamic decompensation or collapse, necessitating potential rescue reperfusion therapy.\n\n4. The guidelines recommend that in the absence of hemodynamic instability, risk stratification should integrate clinical scores, imaging for RV dysfunction, and cardiac biomarker levels to guide decisions on hospitalization, monitoring intensity, and early discharge.\n\nIn summary, elevated cardiac biomarkers serve as an important adjunct to clinical risk scores in PE. When PESI or sPESI indicate low risk, elevated cardiac troponins or other biomarkers, especially when combined with RV dysfunction, identify a subgroup of patients with a higher risk of early death who warrant intermediate-risk classification and closer clinical monitoring. This nuanced stratification helps optimize patient management beyond clinical scores alone."

Surgical pulmonary embolectomy or percutaneous catheter-directed treatment are alternative reperfusion options in patients with contraindications to thrombolysis, if expertise with either of these methods and theappropriateresourcesareavailableon-site.  \nFollowing reperfusion treatment and haemodynamic stabilization, patients recovering from high-risk PE can be switched from  \nparenteral to oral anticoagulation. As patients belonging to this risk category were excluded from the phase III NOAC trials, the optimal time point for this transition has not been determined by existing evidence but should instead be based on clinical judgement. The specifications concerning the higher initial dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban (for 1 and 3 weeks after PE diagnosis, respectively), or the minimum overall period (5 days) of heparin anticoagulation before switching to dabigatran or edoxaban, must be followed (see Supplementary Data Table 8 for tested and approved regimens).",
            "SurgicalembolectomyinacutePEis usually carried out with cardiopulmonary bypass, without aortic cross-clamping and cardioplegic cardiac arrest, followed by incision of the two main pulmonary arteries with the removal or suction of fresh clots. Recent reports have indicated favourable surgical results in highrisk PE, with or without cardiac arrest, and in selected cases of intermediate-risk PE. 297 - 300 Among 174 322 patients hospitalized between 1999 and 2013 with a diagnosis of PE in New York state, survival and recurrence rates were compared between patients who underwent thrombolysis ( n = 1854) or surgical embolectomy ( n = 257) as first-line therapy. 297 Overall, there  \nwas no difference between the two types of reperfusion treatment regarding 30 day mortality (15 and 13%, respectively), but thrombolysis was associated with a higher risk of stroke and reintervention at 30 days. No difference was found in terms of 5 year actuarial survival, but thrombolytic therapy was associated with a higher rate of recurrent PE requiring readmission compared with surgery (7.9 vs. 2.8%). However, the two treatments were not randomly allocated in this observational retrospective study, and the patients referred for surgery may have been selected. An analysis of the Society of Thoracic Surgery Database with multicentre data collection, including 214 patients submitted for surgical embolectomy for high- ( n = 38) or intermediate-risk ( n = 176) PE, revealed an in-hospital mortality rate of 12%, with the worst outcome (32%) in the group experiencing pre-operative cardiac arrest. 299  \nRecent experience appears to support combining ECMO with surgical embolectomy, particularly in patients with high-risk PE with or without the need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Among patients who presented with intermediate-risk PE ( n = 28), high-risk PE without cardiac arrest ( n = 18), and PE with cardiac arrest ( n = 9), the in-hospital and 1 year survival rates were 93 and 91%, respectively. 300",

Use of ECMO is associated with a high incidence of complications, even when used for short periods, and the results depend on the experience of the centre as well as patient selection. The increased risk of bleeding related to the need for vascular access should be considered, particularly in patients undergoing thrombolysis. At present, the use of ECMO as a stand-alone technique with anticoagulation is controversial 247,252 and additional therapies, such as surgical embolectomy, have to be considered.  \nA few cases suggesting good outcomes with use of the Impella V R catheter in patients in shock caused by acute PE have been reported. 253,254",

Patients with overt hemodynamic instability or imminent hemodynamic decompensation, where primary reperfusion treatment (e.g., systemic thrombolysis, surgical embolectomy, or catheter-directed treatment) is anticipated.

Patients with severe obesity, where UFH dosing can be adjusted based on activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) monitoring.\n\nIn contrast, LMWH or fondaparinux are preferred for most other patients due to a lower risk of major bleeding and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and they do not require routine anti-Xa monitoring.

            "In patients with high or intermediate clinical probability of PE (see section 4 ), anticoagulation should be initiated while awaiting the results of diagnostic tests. This is usually done with subcutaneous, weightadjusted low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux (Supplementary Data Table 5 ), or i.v. unfractionated heparin (UFH). Based on pharmacokinetic data (Supplementary Data Table 6 ), 259 an equally rapid anticoagulant effect can also be achieved with a nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), and phase III clinical trials have demonstrated the non-inferior efficacy of a single-oral drug anticoagulation strategy using higher doses of apixaban for 7 days or rivaroxaban for 3 weeks. 259 - 261  \nLMWH and fondaparinux are preferred over UFH for initial anticoagulation in PE, as they carry a lower risk of inducing major bleeding and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. 262 - 265 Neither LMWH nor fondaparinux need routine monitoring of anti-Xa levels. Use of UFH is nowadays largely restricted to patients with overt haemodynamic instability or imminent haemodynamic decompensation in whom primary reperfusion treatment will be necessary. UFH is also recommended for patients with serious renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CrCl) < \\_30 mL/min] or severe obesity. If LMWH is prescribed in patients with CrCl 15 - 30 mL/min, an adapted dosing scheme should be used. The  \ndosing of UFH is adjusted based on the activated partial thromboplastin time (Supplementary Data Table 7 ). 266",
            "For most cases of acute PE without haemodynamic compromise, parenteral or oral anticoagulation (without reperfusion techniques) is adequate treatment. As shown in Figure 6 , normotensive patients with at least one indicator of elevated PE-related risk, or with aggravating conditions or comorbidity, should be hospitalized. In this group, patients with signs of RV dysfunction on echocardiography or CTPA (graphically presented in Figure 3 ), accompanied by a positive troponin test, should be monitored over the first hours or days due to the risk of early haemodynamic decompensation and circulatory collapse. 179 Routine primary reperfusion treatment, notably full-dose systemic thrombolysis, is not recommended, as the risk of potentially life-threatening bleeding complications appears too high for the expected benefits from this treatment. 179 Rescue thrombolytic therapy or, alternatively, surgical embolectomy or percutaneous catheter-directed treatment should be reserved for patients who develop signs of haemodynamic instability. In the PEITHO trial, the mean time between randomization and death or haemodynamic decompensation was 1.79 ± 1.60 days in the placebo (heparin-only) arm. 179 Therefore, it appears reasonable to leave patients with intermediate-high-risk PE on LMWH anticoagulation over the first 2 - 3 days and ensure that they remain stable before switching to oral anticoagulation. As mentioned in the previous section, the specifications concerning the increased initial dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban, or the minimum overall period of heparin anticoagulation before switching to dabigatran or edoxaban, must be followed.  \nSuggestions for the anticoagulation and overall management of acute PE in specific clinical situations, for which conclusive evidence is lacking, are presented in Supplementary Data Table 9 .",

        "response": "Renal function is a critical factor in selecting an anticoagulant for the treatment of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) because it directly influences the choice and dosing of anticoagulants due to their pharmacokinetics and safety profiles. Specifically:\n\n1. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and fondaparinux are preferred over unfractionated heparin (UFH) for initial anticoagulation in most patients with acute PE because they have a lower risk of major bleeding and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. However, both LMWH and fondaparinux are primarily renally cleared.\n\n2. In patients with serious renal impairment, defined as creatinine clearance (CrCl) less than 30 mL/min, UFH is recommended instead of LMWH or fondaparinux. This is because UFH is not predominantly cleared by the kidneys and its anticoagulant effect can be more readily monitored and adjusted via activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).\n\n3. For patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 15-30 mL/min), if LMWH is used, dosing adjustments are necessary to avoid accumulation and increased bleeding risk.\n\n4. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) such as apixaban and rivaroxaban have demonstrated efficacy and rapid anticoagulant effects, but their use also requires consideration of renal function due to renal clearance pathways and dosing recommendations.\n\nIn summary, renal function determines the safety and efficacy of anticoagulant therapy in acute PE by guiding the selection between UFH, LMWH, fondaparinux, and NOACs, as well as dosing adjustments to minimize bleeding risk while ensuring adequate anticoagulation. This is essential to optimize treatment outcomes and avoid complications in patients with impaired renal clearance."

            "NOACs are small molecules that directly inhibit one activated coagulation factor, which is thrombin for dabigatran and factor Xa for apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban. The characteristics of NOACs used in the treatment of acute PE are summarized in Supplementary Data Table 6 . Owing to their predictable bioavailability and pharmacokinetics, NOACs can be given at fixed doses without routine laboratory monitoring. Compared with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), there are fewer interactions when NOACs are given concomitantly with other drugs. 259 In the phase III VTE trials, the dosages of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban were not reduced in patients with mild - moderate renal dysfunction (CrCl between 30 - 60 mL/min), whereas edoxaban was given at a 30 mg dose in these patients. Patients with CrCl <25 mL/min were excluded from the trials testing apixaban, whereas patients with CrCl <30 mL/min were excluded from those investigating rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran (Supplementary Data Table 8 ).  \nPhase III trials on the treatment of acute VTE (Supplementary Data Table 8 ), as well as those on extended treatment beyond the first 6 months (see section 8 ), demonstrated the non-inferiority of NOACs compared with the combination of LMWH with VKA for the prevention of symptomatic or lethal VTE recurrence, along with significantly reduced rates of major bleeding. 267 The different drug regimens tested in these trials are displayed in Supplementary Data Table 8 .Ina meta-analysis, the incidence rate of the primary efficacy outcome was 2.0% for NOAC-treated patients and 2.2% for VKA-treated patients [relative risk (RR) 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 - 1.05]. 268 Major bleeding occurred in 1.1% of NOAC-treated patients and 1.7% of VKAtreated patients for an RR of 0.60 (95% CI 0.41 - 0.88). Compared with VKA-treated patients, critical site major bleeding occurred less frequently in NOAC-treated patients (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.23 - 0.62); in particular, there was a significant reduction in intracranial bleeding (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.21 - 0.68) and in fatal bleeding (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.15 - 0.87) with NOACs compared with VKAs. 268  \nSuggestions for the anticoagulation management of PE in specific clinical situations, for which conclusive evidence is lacking, are presented in Supplementary Data Table 9 .  \nPractical guidance for clinicians regarding the handling of NOACs and the management of emergency situations related to their use are regularly updated by the European Heart Rhythm Association. 259",

            "NOACs are small molecules that directly inhibit one activated coagulation factor, which is thrombin for dabigatran and factor Xa for apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban. The characteristics of NOACs used in the treatment of acute PE are summarized in Supplementary Data Table 6 . Owing to their predictable bioavailability and pharmacokinetics, NOACs can be given at fixed doses without routine laboratory monitoring. Compared with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), there are fewer interactions when NOACs are given concomitantly with other drugs. 259 In the phase III VTE trials, the dosages of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban were not reduced in patients with mild - moderate renal dysfunction (CrCl between 30 - 60 mL/min), whereas edoxaban was given at a 30 mg dose in these patients. Patients with CrCl <25 mL/min were excluded from the trials testing apixaban, whereas patients with CrCl <30 mL/min were excluded from those investigating rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran (Supplementary Data Table 8 ).  \nPhase III trials on the treatment of acute VTE (Supplementary Data Table 8 ), as well as those on extended treatment beyond the first 6 months (see section 8 ), demonstrated the non-inferiority of NOACs compared with the combination of LMWH with VKA for the prevention of symptomatic or lethal VTE recurrence, along with significantly reduced rates of major bleeding. 267 The different drug regimens tested in these trials are displayed in Supplementary Data Table 8 .Ina meta-analysis, the incidence rate of the primary efficacy outcome was 2.0% for NOAC-treated patients and 2.2% for VKA-treated patients [relative risk (RR) 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 - 1.05]. 268 Major bleeding occurred in 1.1% of NOAC-treated patients and 1.7% of VKAtreated patients for an RR of 0.60 (95% CI 0.41 - 0.88). Compared with VKA-treated patients, critical site major bleeding occurred less frequently in NOAC-treated patients (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.23 - 0.62); in particular, there was a significant reduction in intracranial bleeding (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.21 - 0.68) and in fatal bleeding (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.15 - 0.87) with NOACs compared with VKAs. 268  \nSuggestions for the anticoagulation management of PE in specific clinical situations, for which conclusive evidence is lacking, are presented in Supplementary Data Table 9 .  \nPractical guidance for clinicians regarding the handling of NOACs and the management of emergency situations related to their use are regularly updated by the European Heart Rhythm Association. 259",

        "response": "The ESC Class I recommendation for using NOACs (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban) over VKAs in acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is supported by robust clinical evidence from phase III trials and meta-analyses. These studies demonstrated that NOACs are non-inferior to the combination of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and VKAs in preventing symptomatic or fatal venous thromboembolism (VTE) recurrence. Importantly, NOACs are associated with significantly lower rates of major bleeding, including critical site bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and fatal bleeding, compared to VKAs. The predictable pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of NOACs allow fixed dosing without routine laboratory monitoring, and they have fewer drug interactions than VKAs, enhancing their clinical convenience and safety profile.\n\nRegarding contraindications, NOACs are not recommended in the following patient groups:\n- Patients with severe renal impairment (specific thresholds vary by agent: dabigatran contraindicated if creatinine clearance [CrCl] <30 mL/min; edoxaban not recommended if CrCl <15 mL/min; rivaroxaban and apixaban not recommended if CrCl <15 mL/min and used with caution if CrCl 15–29 mL/min).\n- Pregnant or lactating women.\n- Patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.\n\nThese contraindications reflect the lack of safety and efficacy data in these populations and the potential for harm.\n\nIn summary, the ESC Class I recommendation for NOACs over VKAs in acute PE is justified by evidence of equivalent efficacy and superior safety, particularly regarding bleeding risk. NOACs should be avoided in patients with severe renal impairment, pregnancy/lactation, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome."

If the answer to one or more of the questions is 'yes', then the patient cannot be treated at home.  \nBP = blood pressure; b.p.m. = beats per minute; CrCl = creatinine clearance; i.v. = intravenous; PE = pulmonary embolism.  \n$^{a}$ Include the following criteria but leave them to the discretion of the investigator: systolic BP <100 mmHg with heart rate >100 b.p.m.; condition requiring admission to an intensive care unit.  \n$^{b}$ Gastrointestinal bleeding in the preceding 14 days, recent stroke (<4 weeks ago), recent operation (<2 weeks ago), bleeding disorder or thrombocytopenia (platelet count <75 * 10 $^{9}$/L), or uncontrolled hypertension (systolic BP >180 mmHg or diastolic BP >110 mmHg).",
            "As a general rule, early discharge of a patient with acute PE and continuation of anticoagulant treatment at home should be considered if three sets of criteria are fulfilled: (i) the risk of early PE-related death or serious complications is low ( section 5 ); (ii) there is no serious comorbidity or aggravating condition(s) (see section 5 )thatwould mandate hospitalization; and (iii) proper outpatient care and anticoagulant treatment can be provided, considering the patient's (anticipated) compliance, and the possibilities offered by the healthcare system and social infrastructure.  \nRandomized trials and prospective management cohort studies that investigated the feasibility and safety of early discharge, and home treatment, of PE adhered to these principles, even though slightly different criteria or combinations thereof were used to ensure the above three requirements.  \nThe Hestia exclusion criteria (Supplementary Data Table 12 ) represent a checklist of clinical parameters or questions that can be obtained/answered at the bedside. They integrate aspects of PE severity, comorbidity, and the feasibility of home treatment. If the answer to one or more of the questions is 'yes', then the patient cannot be discharged early. In a single-arm management trial that used these criteria to select candidates for home treatment, the 3 month rate of recurrent VTE was 2.0% (0.8 - 4.3%) in patients with acute PE who were discharged within 24 h. 317 In a subsequent non-inferiority trial that randomized 550 patients to direct discharge based on the Hestia criteria alone vs. additional NT-proBNP testing and discharge if levels were < \\_500 pg/mL, the primary outcome (30 day PE- or bleeding-related mortality, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or admission to an intensive care unit) was very low in both arms. The results suggest no incremental value of natriuretic-peptide testing in patients who are eligible for home treatment based on the Hestia criteria, although the study was not powered to exclude this possibility. 318  \nThe PESI and its simplified form, the sPESI ( Table 7 ), also integrate clinical parameters of PE severity and comorbidity to permit assessment of overall 30 day mortality. Compared with the Hestia criteria, the PESI is more standardized, but it contains a less-comprehensive list of aggravating conditions; moreover, the sPESI excludes all patients with cancer from the low-risk category (compare Table 7 with Supplementary Data Table 12 ). The PESI was not primarily developed as a tool to select candidates for home treatment, but it has been used-in combination with additional feasibility criteria-in a trial of 344 patients randomized to inpatient vs. outpatient treatment of PE. 178 One (0.6%) patient in each treatment group died within 90 days. 178  \nIn patients who were included in prospective cohort studies and treated at home, with or without a short hospitalization period, the 3 month rates of thromboembolic recurrence, major bleeding, and death were 1.75, 1.43, and 2.83%, respectively. 327  \nIn summary, the currently available evidence indicates that both the Hestia rule and the PESI or sPESI appear capable of reliably identifying patients who are (i) at low PE-related risk, and (ii) free of serious comorbidity. Consequently, either may be used for clinical triage according to local experience and preference. If a PESI- or sPESIbased approach is chosen, it must be combined with assessment of the feasibility of early discharge and home treatment; this assessment is already integrated into the Hestia criteria.  \nA more difficult decision related to immediate or early discharge is whether the exclusion of intermediate-risk PE on clinical grounds alone is adequate, or whether the assessment of RV dysfunction or myocardial injury (see section 5 )byanimagingtestora laboratory biomarker is necessary to provide maximal safety for the patient in this 'vulnerable' early period. A systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies suggested that the prognostic sensitivity is increased further when clinical criteria (e.g. PESI or sPESI) are combined with imaging findings, or laboratory biomarker levels. 234 A multicentre prospective management trial tested this hypothesis, investigating the efficacy and safety of early discharge, and ambulatory rivaroxaban treatment, in patients selected by clinical criteria and an absence of RV dysfunction.  \nOverall, ~ 20% of the screened unselected patients with PE were included. At the predefined interim analysis of 525 patients (50% of the planned population), the 3 month rate of symptomatic or fatal recurrent VTE was 0.6% (one-sided upper 99.6% CI 2.1%), permitting the early rejection of the null hypothesis and termination of the trial. Major bleeding occurred in six (1.2%) of the patients in the safety population. There were no PE-related deaths. 319 In view of the existing evidence-and taking into consideration (i) the catastrophic scenario of early death if a patient with acute PE is falsely judged to be at low risk on clinical grounds alone and discharged 'too early' (as described in a prematurely terminated trial), and (ii) the ease and minimal additional effort of assessing RV size and function at presentation by echocardiography, or on the CTPA performed to diagnose the PE event itself ( section 5 )-it is wise to exclude RV dysfunction and right heart thrombi if immediate or early (within the first 24 - 48 h) discharge of the patient is planned.",

High-risk PE is defined by haemodynamic instability and encompasses the forms of clinical presentation shown in Table 4 .  \nAs an immediately life-threatening situation, high-risk PE requires an emergency diagnostic (upon suspicion) and therapeutic (upon confirmation or if the level of suspicion is sufficiently high) strategy, as outlined in section 7 . However, the absence of haemodynamic instability does not exclude beginning (and possibly progressing) RV dysfunction, and thus an elevated PE-related early risk.

        "response": "The recommended initial diagnostic approach for patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) who are haemodynamically unstable is to perform a bedside transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) as the most useful initial test. This test aims to detect acute right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, which, if present, strongly supports the diagnosis of high-risk PE causing haemodynamic decompensation. In cases of severe instability, echocardiographic evidence of RV dysfunction alone is sufficient to initiate immediate reperfusion therapy without further diagnostic testing.\n\nAncillary bedside imaging tests may include transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE), which can directly visualize thrombi in the pulmonary artery and its main branches, and bilateral venous compression ultrasonography (CUS) to detect proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT). These tests are particularly useful when computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is not immediately feasible.\n\nOnce the patient is stabilized, confirmation of the diagnosis by CTPA should be sought. If the patient is admitted directly to the catheterization laboratory with suspected acute coronary syndrome and PE is a probable alternative diagnosis, pulmonary angiography may be considered after excluding acute coronary syndrome, especially if catheter-directed treatment is an option.\n\nThe diagnostic algorithm for haemodynamically unstable patients with suspected high-risk PE is as follows:\n1. Perform bedside TTE to assess for RV dysfunction (RV/LV diameter ratio >1.0).\n2. If no RV dysfunction is found, search for other causes of shock or instability.\n3. If RV dysfunction is present, perform CTPA immediately if feasible.\n4. If CTPA is not available or the patient's condition only allows bedside tests, echocardiographic findings of RV dysfunction confirm high-risk PE, and emergency reperfusion therapy is recommended.\n5. If CTPA is positive, treat as high-risk PE.\n6. If CTPA is negative, investigate other causes of shock or instability.\n\nHaemodynamic instability is defined by clinical manifestations such as cardiac arrest, obstructive shock (systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg or vasopressors required despite adequate filling status, with end-organ hypoperfusion), or persistent hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg or a drop ≥40 mmHg lasting longer than 15 minutes not caused by arrhythmia, hypovolaemia, or sepsis).\n\nIn summary, the initial diagnostic approach in haemodynamically unstable patients with suspected PE prioritizes rapid bedside echocardiographic assessment of RV function to guide immediate management, with subsequent confirmatory imaging once the patient is stabilized."

            "In addition to the clinical, imaging, and laboratory findings, which are directly linked to PE severity and PE-related early death, baseline parameters related to aggravating conditions and comorbidity are necessary to assess a patient's overall mortality risk and early outcome. Of the clinical scores integrating PE severity and comorbidity, the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) ( Table 7 ) is the one that has been most extensively validated to date. The principal strength of the PESI lies in the reliable identification of patients at low risk for 30 day mortality (PESI classes I and II). One randomized trial employed a low PESI as the principal inclusion criterion for home treatment of acute PE. 178  \nIn view of the complexity of the original PESI, which includes differently weighed variables, a simplified version (sPESI; Table 7) has been developed and validated. As with the original version of the PESI, the strength of the sPESI lies in the reliable identification of patients at low risk for 30 day mortality. The prognostic performance of the sPESI has been confirmed in observational cohort studies, although this index has not yet been prospectively used to guide therapeutic management of low-risk PE patients.  \nThe diagnosis of concomitant DVT has been identified as an adverse prognostic factor, being independently associated with death within the first 3 months after acute PE. In a meta-analysis investigating 8859 patients with PE, the presence of concomitant DVT was confirmed as a predictor of 30 day all-cause mortality (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.5 - 2.4), although it did not predict PE-related adverse outcomes at 90 days. Thus, concomitant DVT can be regarded as an indicator of significant comorbidity in acute PE.",
            "Five RCTs compared LMWH vs. conventional VTE treatment (heparin followed by VKA) in the treatment of VTE in cancer-associated thrombosis. In 2003, a significant reduction in VTE recurrence was reported with LMWH compared with conventional (VKA) treatment without an increase in bleeding complications. In a more recent trial, long-term administration of tinzaparin failed to achieve a statistically significant reduction in overall VTE recurrence over conventional treatment (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.41 - 1.03); however, the overall rate of recurrent VTE in the control arm was lower than that previously observed, probably as a result of the recruitment of patients with a lower cancer-specific thrombotic risk. Overall, LMWHs were found to decrease the risk of recurrent VTE by 40% with a risk of major bleeding complications similar to that of VKAs. 365 Accordingly, LMWHs have become the standard of care. However, these agents are associated with a relevant cost and burden for patients. In addition, the absolute rate of recurrent VTE while on LMWH remains high (7 - 9%) compared with that observed in noncancer patients with VTE on conventional treatment (1.5 - 3%).  \nNOACs could make the treatment of VTE easier and more convenient in patients with cancer, due to their oral administration i nfixe d-dose regimens and their lower cost compared with LMWH. However, only 3 - 9% of patients included in phase III studies with NOACs for the treatment of VTE had concomitant cancer. A randomized, open-label trial compared edoxaban with LMWH in the secondary prevention of VTE in 1050 patients with cancer-associated thrombosis (mostly symptomatic or asymptomatic PE).$^{366}$Edoxaban (60 mg o.d., reduced to 30 mg in subjects with moderate renal impairment, low body weight, or concomitant need for strong inhibitors of glycoprotein-P) was started after 5 days of LMWH and treatment was given for > \\_6 months. Edoxaban was non-inferior to dalteparin in the prevention of VTE recurrence or major bleeding over 12 months after randomization (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.70 - 1.36). Major bleeding occurred in 6.9% of the patients in the edoxaban arm and 4.0% in the dalteparin arm (difference in risk 2.9 percentage points, 95% CI 0.1 - 5.6). This difference appears to have been mainly accounted for by the high rate of bleeding in patients with gastrointestinal cancer allocated to the edoxaban group. 366 Similar results were reported by a randomized, open-label pilot trial comparing rivaroxaban with dalteparin in 406 patients with VTE and cancer, 58% of whom had metastases. 367 A significant decrease in the risk of recurrent VTE was observed with rivaroxaban (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.19 - 0.99). The 6 month cumulative rate of major bleeding, which was mostly gastrointestinal, was 6% (95% CI 3 - 11%) for rivaroxaban and 4% (95% CI 2 - 8%) for dalteparin (HR 1.83, 95% CI 0.68 - 4.96). Corresponding rates of CRNM bleeds were 13% (95% CI 9 - 19%) and 4% (95% CI 2 - 9%), respectively (HR 3.76, 95% CI 1.63 - 8.69).  \nBased on the currently available evidence, as described above, patients with acute PE and cancer, particularly those with gastrointestinal cancer, should be encouraged to continue LMWH for > \\_3 - 6 months. This also applies to patients in whom oral treatment is unfeasible due to problems of intake or absorption, and to those with  \nsevere renal impairment. In all other cases, especially in patients with an anticipated low risk of bleeding and without gastrointestinal tumours, the choice between LMWH and edoxaban or rivaroxaban is left to the discretion of the physician, and the patient's preference.  \nOwing to the high risk for recurrence, patients with cancer should receive indefinite anticoagulation after a first episode of VTE. Although existing evidence is limited, it is conceivable that once cancer is cured the risk for recurrence decreases and anticoagulation can be stopped. However, the definition of cured cancer is not always clear. The risk of recurrence of PE in cancer was assessed in a cohort study of 543 patients and was validated in an independent set of 819 patients. 368 The proposed score to predict the risk of recurrence included breast cancer (minus 1 point), Tumour Node Metastasis stage I or II (minus 1 point), and female sex, lung cancer, and previous VTE (plus 1 point each). Patients with a score < \\_0 were at low risk (< \\_4.5%) and those with a score > \\_1 were at high (> \\_19%) risk of VTE recurrence over the first 6 months.  \nAfter the first 3 - 6 months, extended anticoagulation may consist of continuation of LMWH or transition to an oral anticoagulant. Two cohort studies have assessed the safety of extended treatment with LMWH (< \\_12 months) in cancer-associated thrombosis. In both studies, the incidence of bleeding complications was higher in the first months and then reached a plateau that remained unchanged after the sixth month. In the absence of conclusive evidence, the decision to continue with LMWH or to change to VKA or a NOAC should be made on a case-by-case basis after consideration of the success of anticancer therapy, the estimated risk of recurrence of VTE, the bleeding risk, and the preference of the patient. Periodic reassessment of the risk-to-benefit ratio of continued anticoagulant treatment is mandatory.  \nAs mentioned in section 5, venous filters are principally indicated when anticoagulation is impossible due to active haemorrhage or an excessive bleeding risk. However, the risk of VTE recurrence in the absence of anticoagulation is particularly high in patients with cancer, and the insertion of a filter should not delay the initiation of anticoagulation as soon as it is safe to do so. There is no evidence to support the use of venous filters as an adjunct to anticoagulation treatment in patients with cancer.  \nA number of studies have reported that a proportion of patients presenting with PE in the absence of identifiable risk factors develop cancer within the first year after diagnosis. Consequently, the optimal strategy to achieve early diagnosis of these occult cancers was investigated. Two large randomized trials failed to show that comprehensive CT of the abdomen or $^{18}$F deoxy-fluoro-glucose positron emission tomography were able to detect more cancers than limited screening in patients with an unprovoked VTE. Therefore, based on current evidence, the search for occult cancer after an episode of VTE may be restricted to careful history taking, physical examination, basic laboratory tests, and a chest X-ray (if no CTPA was performed to diagnose PE).  \nIn patients with cancer, incidental PE should be managed in the same manner as symptomatic PE, whether it involves segmental or more proximal branches, multiple subsegmental vessels, or a single subsegmental vessel in association with detectable DVT.",
            "Venous thromboembolism (VTE), clinically presenting as DVT or PE, is globally the third most frequent acute cardiovascular syndrome behind myocardial infarction and stroke. 2 In epidemiological studies, annual incidence rates for PE range from 39 - 115 per 100 000 population; for DVT, incidence rates range from 53 - 162 per 100 000 population. 3,4 Cross-sectional data show that the incidence of VTE is almost eight times higher in individuals aged > \\_80 years than in the fifth decade of life. 3 In parallel, longitudinal studies have revealed a rising tendency in annual PE incidence rates 4 - 7 over time. Together with the substantial hospitalassociated, preventable, and indirect annual expenditures for VTE (an estimated total of up to e 8.5 billion in the European Union), 8 these data demonstrate the importance of PE and DVT in ageing populations in Europe and other areas of the world. They further suggest that VTE will increasingly pose a burden on health systems worldwide in the years to come.  \nPE may cause < \\_300 000 deaths per year in the US, ranking high among the causes of cardiovascular mortality. 3 In six European countries with a total population of 454.4 million, more than 370 000 deaths were related to VTE in 2004, as estimated on the basis of an epidemiological model. 9 Of these patients, 34% died suddenly or within a few hours of the acute event, before therapy could be initiated or take effect. Of the other patients, death resulted from acute PE that was diagnosed after death in 59% and only 7% of patients who died early were correctly diagnosed with PE before death.  \nTime trend analyses in European, Asian, and North American populations suggest that case fatality rates of acute PE may be decreasing. 4 - 7,10,11 Increased use of more effective therapies and interventions, and possibly better adherence to guidelines, 12,13 has most likely exerted a significant positive effect on the prognosis of PE in recent years. However, there is also a tendency towards overdiagnosis of (subsegmental or even non-existent) PE in the modern era, 14 and this might in turn lead to a false drop in case fatality rates by inflating the denominator, i.e. the total number of PE cases.  \nFigure 1 summarizes the existing data on global trends in PE, highlighting increasing incidence rates in parallel with decreasing case fatality rates over an ~ 15 year period.  \nIn children, studies have reported an annual incidence of VTE of between 53 - 57 per 100 000 among hospitalized patients, 19,20 and between 1.4 - 4.9 per 100 000 in the community overall. 21,22"

        "response": "Comorbidities such as cancer and heart failure significantly influence the interpretation of pulmonary embolism (PE) incidence and risk by affecting both the baseline mortality risk and the risk of PE recurrence.\n\n1. Impact on Mortality Risk and Prognosis:\n- Comorbidities are integral to assessing overall mortality risk in PE patients. Clinical scores like the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) and its simplified version (sPESI) incorporate comorbid conditions to stratify patients by 30-day mortality risk. These scores reliably identify low-risk patients but also highlight that comorbidities contribute to worse outcomes.\n- The presence of concomitant deep vein thrombosis (DVT), often associated with comorbidities, independently predicts higher short-term mortality after PE.\n\n2. Cancer-Associated Thrombosis:\n- Cancer is a major comorbidity that increases both the incidence and recurrence risk of PE. Patients with cancer have a higher baseline risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including PE, and a higher risk of recurrence despite anticoagulation.\n- Treatment of PE in cancer patients is complicated by a higher risk of bleeding and recurrent VTE. Low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) are the standard of care, reducing recurrence risk by about 40% compared to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), but recurrence rates remain higher than in non-cancer patients.\n- New oral anticoagulants (NOACs) offer convenience but have limited data in cancer patients and may increase bleeding risk, especially in gastrointestinal cancers.\n- Cancer patients often require extended or indefinite anticoagulation due to ongoing thrombotic risk, with periodic reassessment based on cancer status and bleeding risk.\n- The presence of cancer also complicates the interpretation of PE incidence, as some patients with unprovoked PE may have occult malignancy diagnosed subsequently.\n\n3. Heart Failure and Other Comorbidities:\n- Although specific details on heart failure were not extensively detailed in the retrieved information, it is recognized as a comorbidity that contributes to overall mortality risk in PE.\n- Comorbid conditions like heart failure likely increase the complexity of risk stratification and may worsen prognosis, necessitating their inclusion in clinical risk scores.\n\nSummary:\nComorbidities such as cancer and heart failure elevate the baseline risk of PE incidence, recurrence, and mortality. They necessitate careful risk stratification using validated tools like PESI/sPESI and influence treatment decisions, particularly regarding anticoagulation strategies and duration. Cancer notably increases both thrombotic and bleeding risks, requiring individualized management and vigilant follow-up."

            "The combination of symptoms and clinical findings with the presence of predisposing factors for VTE allows the classification of patients with suspected PE into distinct categories of clinical or pre-test probability, which correspond to an increasing actual prevalence of confirmed PE. This pre-test assessment can be done either by implicit (empirical) clinical judgement or by using prediction rules. As the post-test (i.e. after an imaging test) probability of PE depends not only on the characteristics of the diagnostic test itself but also on the pretest probability, this is a key step in all diagnostic algorithms for PE.  \nThe value of empirical clinical judgement has been confirmed in several large series. Clinical judgement usually includes commonplace tests such as chest X-rays and electrocardiograms for differential diagnosis. However, as clinical judgement lacks standardization, several explicit clinical prediction rules have been developed. Of these, the most frequently used prediction rules are the revised Geneva rule ( Table 5 ) and the Wells rule (see Supplementary Data Table 1). Both prediction rules have been simplified in an attempt to increase their adoption into clinical practice; the simplified versions have been externally validated.  \nRegardless of the score used, the proportion of patients with confirmed PE can be expected to be ~ 10% in the low-probability category, 30% in the moderate-probability category, and 65% in the highprobability category. When the two-level classification is used, the proportion of patients with confirmed PE is ~ 12% in the PE-unlikely category and 30% in the PE-likely category. A direct prospective comparison of these rules confirmed a similar diagnostic performance.",

According to the guidelines, D-dimer measurement is not recommended in patients with high clinical probability of PE due to its low negative predictive value in this population. Instead, the diagnostic approach in such cases is to proceed directly to imaging, specifically computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA).\n\nIf CTPA is negative in a patient with high clinical probability, the guidelines suggest that further imaging tests may be considered before withholding PE-specific treatment, as false-negative CTPA results, although infrequent, have been reported in this group. Therefore, a negative D-dimer in a high clinical probability patient does not exclude PE, and further diagnostic imaging is mandatory to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.\n\nSummary: In a hemodynamically stable patient with high clinical probability of PE, a negative D-dimer test does not rule out PE. CTPA should be performed, and if negative, further imaging may be warranted before excluding PE and withholding treatment."

        "retrieved_contexts": [
            "The planar ventilation/perfusion [V/Q (lung scintigraphy)] scan is an established diagnostic test for suspected PE. Perfusion scans are combined with ventilation studies, for which multiple tracers such as xenon-133 gas, krypton-81 gas, technetium-99m-labelled aerosols, or technetium-99m-labelled carbon microparticles (Technegas) can be used. The purpose of the ventilation scan is to increase specificity: in acute PE, ventilation is expected to be normal in hypoperfused segments (mismatched). Being a lower-radiation and contrast mediumsparing procedure, the V/Q scan may preferentially be applied in outpatients with a low clinical probability and a normal chest X-ray, in young (particularly female) patients, in pregnant women, in patients  \nwith history of contrast medium-induced anaphylaxis, and patients with severe renal failure.  \nPlanar lung scan results are frequently classified according to the criteria established in the PIOPED study. 117 These criteria were the subject of debate and have been revised. To facilitate communication with clinicians, a three-tier classification is preferable: normal scan (excluding PE), high-probability scan (considered diagnostic of PE in most patients), and non-diagnostic scan. 120 - 122 Prospective clinical outcome studies suggested that it is safe to withhold anticoagulant therapy in patients with a normal perfusion scan. This was con -firm ed by a randomized trial comparing the V/Q scan with CTPA. 122 An analysis from the PIOPED II study suggested that a highprobability V/Q scan could confirm PE, although other sources suggest that the positive predictive value of a high-probability lung scan is not sufficient to confirm PE in patients with a low clinical probability.s  \nPerforming only a perfusion scan might be acceptable in patients with a normal chest X-ray; any perfusion defect in this situation would be considered a mismatch. The high frequency of nondiagnostic scans is a limitation because they indicate the necessity for further diagnostic testing. Various strategies to overcome this problem have been proposed, notably the incorporation of clinical probability. Although the use of perfusion scanning and chest X-ray with the Prospective Investigative Study of Acute Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis (PISAPED) criteria may be associated with a low rate of inconclusive results, the sensitivity appears too low to exclude PE and thus this approach may be less safe than CTPA.  \nSeveral studies suggest that data acquisition in single-photon emission CT (SPECT) imaging, with or without low-dose CT, may decrease the proportion of non-diagnostic scans to as low as 0 - 5%. 121,126 - 128 However, most studies reporting on the accuracy of SPECT are limited by their retrospective design 129,130 or the inclusion of SPECT itself in the reference standard, 127 and only one study used a validated diagnostic algorithm. 131 The diagnostic criteria for SPECT also varied; most studies defined PE as one or two subsegmental perfusion defects without ventilation defects, but these criteria are infrequently used in clinical practice. In addition, the optimal scanning technique (perfusion SPECT, V/Q SPECT, perfusion SPECT with non-enhanced CT, or V/Q SPECT with non-enhanced CT) remains to be defined. Finally, few outcome studies are available, and with incomplete follow-up. 132 Large-scale prospective studies are needed to validate SPECT techniques.  \nThe major strengths, weaknesses/limitations, and radiation issues related to the use of V/Q scan and V/Q SPECT in the diagnosis of PE are summarized in Table 6 .",
            "In hospitals in which V/Q scintigraphy is readily available, it is a valid option for patients with an elevated D-dimer and a contraindication to CTPA. Also, V/Q scintigraphy may be preferred over CTPA to avoid unnecessary radiation, particularly in younger patients and in female patients in whom thoracic CT might raise the lifetime risk of breast cancer. V/Q lung scintigraphy is diagnostic (with either normal- or high-probability findings) in ~ 30 - 50% of emergency ward patients with suspected PE. The proportion of diagnostic V/Q scans is higher in patients with a normal chest X-ray, and this might support the use of a V/Q scan as a first-line imaging test for PE in younger patients, depending on local availability. The number of patients with inconclusive findings may further be reduced by taking into account clinical probability. Thus, patients with a non-diagnostic lung scan and low clinical probability of PE have a low prevalence of confirmed PE, and the negative predictive value of this combination is further increased by the absence of a DVT on lower-limb CUS. If a highprobability lung scan is obtained from a patient with low clinical probability of PE, confirmation by other tests should be considered.",

            "In hospitals in which V/Q scintigraphy is readily available, it is a valid option for patients with an elevated D-dimer and a contraindication to CTPA. Also, V/Q scintigraphy may be preferred over CTPA to avoid unnecessary radiation, particularly in younger patients and in female patients in whom thoracic CT might raise the lifetime risk of breast cancer. V/Q lung scintigraphy is diagnostic (with either normal- or high-probability findings) in ~ 30 - 50% of emergency ward patients with suspected PE. The proportion of diagnostic V/Q scans is higher in patients with a normal chest X-ray, and this might support the use of a V/Q scan as a first-line imaging test for PE in younger patients, depending on local availability. The number of patients with inconclusive findings may further be reduced by taking into account clinical probability. Thus, patients with a non-diagnostic lung scan and low clinical probability of PE have a low prevalence of confirmed PE, and the negative predictive value of this combination is further increased by the absence of a DVT on lower-limb CUS. If a highprobability lung scan is obtained from a patient with low clinical probability of PE, confirmation by other tests should be considered.",
            "Multidetector CTPA is the method of choice for imaging the pulmonary vasculature in patients with suspected PE. It allows adequate visualization of the pulmonary arteries down to the subsegmental level. The Prospective Investigation On Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis (PIOPED) II study observed a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 96% for (mainly four-detector) CTPA in PE diagnosis. 115 PIOPED II also highlighted the influence of pre-test clinical probability on the predictive value of multidetector CTPA. In patients with a low or intermediate clinical probability of PE, a negative CTPA had a high negative predictive value for PE (96 and 89%, respectively), but its negative predictive value was only 60% if the pre-test probability was high. Conversely, the positive predictive value of a positive CTPA was high (92 - 96%) in patients with an intermediate or high clinical probability, but much lower (58%) in patients with a low pre-test likelihood of PE. 115 Therefore, clinicians should consider further testing in case of discordance between clinical judgement and the CTPA result.  \nSeveral studies have provided evidence in favour of CTPA as a stand-alone imaging test for excluding PE. Taken together, the available data suggest that a negative CTPA result is an adequate criterion for the exclusion of PE in patients with low or intermediate clinical probability of PE. On the other hand, it remains controversial whether patients with a negative CTPA and a high clinical probability should be further investigated.  \nChronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a potentially fatal late sequela of PE, but pre-existing CTEPH should not be missed in patients investigated for suspected acute PE. Signs of preexisting CTEPH on CTPA are listed in Supplementary Data Table 2 ; the diagnosis and management of CTEPH is discussed in section 10 .  \nThe major strengths, weaknesses/limitations, and radiation issues related to the use of CTPA in the diagnosis of PE are summarized in Table 6 .",

Clinical Probability and D-dimer: \n   - The clinical probability of PE should be assessed using clinical judgment or prediction rules.\n   - In patients with low or intermediate clinical probability and a positive D-dimer, CTPA is generally recommended as the next step.\n   - In patients with high clinical probability, CTPA is also the preferred initial imaging test.\n\n2. Imaging Modality Considerations in Pregnancy:\n   - CTPA is the method of choice for imaging the pulmonary vasculature, with high sensitivity and specificity.\n   - However, CTPA involves radiation exposure to the mother’s breast tissue, which is a concern in young female patients, including pregnant women.\n   - V/Q scintigraphy (lung scan) is a valid alternative, especially in centers where it is readily available.\n   - V/Q scan has lower radiation exposure compared to CTPA and almost no contraindications.\n   - V/Q scan is particularly preferred if the chest X-ray is normal, as it increases the likelihood of a diagnostic scan.\n   - The proportion of diagnostic V/Q scans is higher in patients with a normal chest X-ray, and the negative predictive value is enhanced when combined with clinical probability assessment and absence of DVT.\n\n3. Practical Approach:\n   - If the chest X-ray is normal and V/Q scan is readily available, V/Q scan may be preferred to minimize radiation exposure to the breast tissue and fetus.\n   - If V/Q scan is not available or the chest X-ray is abnormal, CTPA is the preferred imaging modality.\n   - Both tests have strong validation in prospective studies, but CTPA provides additional information and alternative diagnoses if PE is excluded.\n   - The decision should also consider local expertise and availability of imaging modalities.\n\nSummary:\nFor a hemodynamically stable pregnant woman with suspected PE, positive D-dimer, and no signs of DVT, V/Q scan is preferred as the first imaging test if the chest X-ray is normal and V/Q is readily available, due to lower radiation exposure. Otherwise, CTPA is the preferred initial test. Clinical probability assessment and chest X-ray findings should guide the choice of imaging modality."

Testing for laboratory biomarkers such as cardiac troponins or natriuretic peptides is not necessary for immediate therapeutic decisions in patients with high-risk PE.  \nIn the absence of haemodynamic instability at presentation, further risk stratification of PE is recommended, as it has implications for early discharge vs. hospitalization or monitoring of the patient (explained in section 7 ). Table 8 provides an overview of the clinical, imaging, and laboratory parameters used to distinguish intermediateand low-risk PE. The PESI is-in its original or simplified form-the most extensively validated and most broadly used clinical score to date, as it integrates baseline indicators of the severity of the acute PE episode with aggravating conditions and the comorbidity of the patient. Overall, a PESI of class I - II or an sPESI of 0 is a reliable predictor of low-risk PE.  \nIn addition to clinical parameters, patients in the intermediate-risk group who display evidence of both RV dysfunction (on echocardiography or CTPA) and elevated cardiac biomarker levels in the circulation (particularly a positive cardiac troponin test) are classified into the intermediate-high-risk category. As will be discussed in more detail in section 7 , close monitoring is recommended in these cases to permit the early detection of haemodynamic decompensation or collapse, and consequently the need for rescue reperfusion therapy. 179 Patients in whom the RV appears normal on echocardiography or CTPA, and/or who have normal cardiac biomarker levels, belong to the intermediate-low-risk category. As an alternative approach, use of further prognostic scores combining clinical, imaging, and laboratory parameters may be considered to semi-quantitatively assess the severity of the PE episode, and distinguish intermediate-high-risk and intermediate-low-risk PE. Supplementary Data Table 4 lists the scores most frequently investigated for this purpose in observational (cohort) studies; however, none of them has been used in RCTs to date.  \nA recent meta-analysis included 21 cohort studies with a total of 3295 patients with 'low-risk' PE based on a PESI of I - II or an sPESI of 0. 234 Overall, 34% (95% CI 30 - 39%) of them were reported to have signs of RV dysfunction on echocardiography or CTPA. Data on early mortality were provided in seven studies (1597 patients) and revealed an OR of 4.19 (95% CI 1.39 - 12.58) for death from any cause in the presence of RV dysfunction; elevated cardiac troponin levels were associated with a comparable magnitude of risk elevation. 234 Early all-cause mortality rates (1.8% for RV dysfunction and 3.8% for elevated troponin levels) were in the lower range of those previously reported for patients with intermediate-risk PE. 235 Until the clinical implications of such discrepancies are clarified, patients with signs of RV dysfunction or elevated cardiac biomarkers, despite a low PESI or an sPESI of 0, should be classified into the intermediate-low-risk category.",

            "In patients who present without haemodynamic instability, individual baseline findings may not suffice to determine and further classify PE severity and PE-related early risk when used as stand-alone parameters. As a result, various combinations of the clinical, imaging, and laboratory parameters described above have been used to build prognostic scores, which permit a (semi)quantitative assessment of early PE-related risk of death. Of these, the Bova 218 - 221 and the HFABP (or high-sensitivity troponin T), Syncope, Tachycardia (FAST) scores 219,222,223 have been validated in cohort studies (see Supplementary Data Table 4 ). However, their implications for patient management remain unclear. To date, only a combination of RV dysfunction on an echocardiogram (or CTPA) with a positive cardiac troponin test has directly been tested as a guide for early therapeutic decisions (anticoagulation plus reperfusion treatment vs. anticoagulation alone) in a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) of PE patients presenting without haemodynamic instability. 224",

        "response": "In a haemodynamically stable patient with acute pulmonary embolism (PE), a simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (sPESI) score of 0 generally indicates low risk. However, the presence of right ventricular (RV) dilation on computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) and elevated cardiac troponin levels modifies this risk assessment.\n\nAccording to the guidelines, patients without haemodynamic instability but with both RV dysfunction (detected by echocardiography or CTPA) and elevated cardiac biomarkers (such as troponin) are classified as intermediate-high risk for early mortality. This classification applies even if the sPESI is 0, which would otherwise suggest low risk. The rationale is that these patients have a higher risk of early clinical deterioration and death compared to those with normal RV function and normal biomarkers.\n\nThe guidelines recommend close monitoring of intermediate-high-risk patients to detect early haemodynamic decompensation and to consider rescue reperfusion therapy if deterioration occurs. This contrasts with patients who have either RV dysfunction or elevated biomarkers alone (but not both), who are classified as intermediate-low risk and warrant hospitalization but not necessarily intensive monitoring.\n\nIn summary, your patient, who is haemodynamically stable with sPESI 0 but has RV dilation on CTPA and elevated troponin, should be classified as intermediate-high risk for early mortality. This classification guides the need for close clinical monitoring and readiness for escalation of therapy if clinical status worsens."

            "The proposed strategy is shown in Figure 4 . The clinical probability is usually high and the differential diagnosis includes cardiac tamponade, acute coronary syndrome, aortic dissection, acute valvular dysfunction, and hypovolaemia. The most useful initial test in this situation is bedside TTE, which will yield evidence of acute RV dysfunction if acute PE is the cause of the patient's haemodynamic decompensation. In a highly unstable patient, echocardiographic evidence of RV dysfunction is sufficient to prompt immediate reperfusion without further testing. This decision may be strengthened by the (rare) visualization of right heart thrombi. 155,157,321,322 Ancillary bedside imaging tests include TOE, which may allow direct visualization of thrombi in the pulmonary artery and its main branches, especially in patients with RV dysfunction. TOE should be cautiously performed in hypoxaemic patients. Moreover, bedside CUS can detect proximal DVT. As soon as the patient is stabilized using supportive treatment, final confirmation of the diagnosis by CT angiography should be sought.  \nFor unstable patients admitted directly to the catheterization laboratory with suspected acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary angiography may be considered as a diagnostic procedure after the acute coronary syndrome has been excluded, provided that PE is a probable diagnostic alternative and particularly if percutaneous catheterdirected treatment is a therapeutic option.",

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have suggested that RV dysfunction on echocardiography is associated with an elevated risk of short-term mortality in patients who appear haemodynamically stable at presentation, 180,181 but its overall positive predictive value for PE-related death was low (<10%) in a metaanalysis. 180 This weakness is partly related to the fact that echocardiographic parameters have proved difficult to standardize. Nevertheless, echocardiographic assessment of the morphology and function of the RV is widely recognized as a valuable tool for the prognostic assessment of normotensive patients with acute PE in clinical practice.  \nIn addition to RV dysfunction, echocardiography can identify rightto-left shunt through a patent foramen ovale and the presence of right heart thrombi, both of which are associated with increased  \nmortality in patients with acute PE. A patent foramen ovale also increases the risk of ischaemic stroke due to paradoxical embolism in patients with acute PE and RV dysfunction.",

High-risk PE is defined by haemodynamic instability and encompasses the forms of clinical presentation shown in Table 4 .  \nAs an immediately life-threatening situation, high-risk PE requires an emergency diagnostic (upon suspicion) and therapeutic (upon confirmation or if the level of suspicion is sufficiently high) strategy, as outlined in section 7 . However, the absence of haemodynamic instability does not exclude beginning (and possibly progressing) RV dysfunction, and thus an elevated PE-related early risk. In this large population, further assessment (outlined in sections 5 and 7 ) is necessary to determine the level of risk and adjust management decisions accordingly.",

            "In patients with high or intermediate clinical probability of PE (see section 4 ), anticoagulation should be initiated while awaiting the results of diagnostic tests. This is usually done with subcutaneous, weightadjusted low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux (Supplementary Data Table 5 ), or i.v. unfractionated heparin (UFH). Based on pharmacokinetic data (Supplementary Data Table 6 ), 259 an equally rapid anticoagulant effect can also be achieved with a nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), and phase III clinical trials have demonstrated the non-inferior efficacy of a single-oral drug anticoagulation strategy using higher doses of apixaban for 7 days or rivaroxaban for 3 weeks. 259 - 261  \nLMWH and fondaparinux are preferred over UFH for initial anticoagulation in PE, as they carry a lower risk of inducing major bleeding and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. 262 - 265 Neither LMWH nor fondaparinux need routine monitoring of anti-Xa levels. Use of UFH is nowadays largely restricted to patients with overt haemodynamic instability or imminent haemodynamic decompensation in whom primary reperfusion treatment will be necessary. UFH is also recommended for patients with serious renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CrCl) < \\_30 mL/min] or severe obesity. If LMWH is prescribed in patients with CrCl 15 - 30 mL/min, an adapted dosing scheme should be used. The  \ndosing of UFH is adjusted based on the activated partial thromboplastin time (Supplementary Data Table 7 ). 266",

        "response": "In a 78-year-old patient with newly diagnosed pulmonary embolism (PE) and a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 25 mL/min, the preferred anticoagulant regimen is unfractionated heparin (UFH) rather than low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). \n\nThis preference is based on the following guideline recommendations and rationale:\n\n1. Patients with serious renal impairment, defined as CrCl <30 mL/min, are recommended to receive UFH for initial anticoagulation. UFH dosing can be adjusted based on activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) monitoring, allowing for safer management in the context of reduced renal clearance.\n\n2. LMWH and fondaparinux, although generally preferred over UFH due to lower bleeding risk and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, require dose adjustment in patients with CrCl between 15-30 mL/min and are used with caution. However, in severe renal impairment, UFH is favored because it is not renally cleared and its anticoagulant effect can be more readily controlled and reversed.\n\n3. NOACs are generally avoided in patients with severe renal impairment. Specifically, dabigatran is not recommended for CrCl <30 mL/min; edoxaban is not recommended for CrCl <15 mL/min and requires dose adjustment for CrCl 15-50 mL/min; rivaroxaban and apixaban should be used with caution in CrCl 15-29 mL/min and are not recommended below 15 mL/min. Given the patient's CrCl of 25 mL/min, NOACs pose a higher risk and are not the preferred choice.\n\nIn summary, for this elderly patient with PE and CrCl of 25 mL/min, UFH is the preferred initial anticoagulant due to its safety profile in severe renal impairment, ability to be monitored and dose-adjusted via aPTT, and avoidance of accumulation risks associated with LMWH and NOACs in this setting."

            "Incidence estimates from cohort studies conducted more than 15 years ago reported an ~ 3% annual incidence of major bleeding in patients treated with VKAs. 345 Meta-analyses of phase III studies focusing on the first 3 - 12 months of anticoagulant treatment showed an ~ 40% reduction in the risk for major bleeding with NOACs compared with VKAs. 346 The risk of major bleeding is higher in the first month of anticoagulant treatment, and then declines and remains stable over time. Based on currently available evidence, risk factors include: (i) advanced age (particularly >75 years); (ii) previous bleeding (if not associated with a reversible or treatable cause) or anaemia; (iii) active cancer; (iv) previous stroke, either haemorrhagic or ischaemic; (v) chronic renal or hepatic disease; (vi) concomitant antiplatelet therapy or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (to be avoided, if possible); (vii) other serious acute or chronic illness; and (viii) poor anticoagulation control.  \nExisting bleeding risk scores and their current validation status are reviewed in Supplementary Data Table 14 . The patient's bleeding risk should be assessed, either by implicit judgement after evaluating individual risk factors or by the use of a bleeding risk score, at the time of initiation of anticoagulant treatment. It should be reassessed periodically (e.g. once a year in patients at low risk, and every 3 or 6 months in patients at high risk for bleeding). Bleeding risk assessment should be used to identify and treat modifiable bleeding risk factors, and it may influence decision-making on the duration and regimen/dose of anticoagulant treatment after acute PE.",
            "In patients with high or intermediate clinical probability of PE (see section 4 ), anticoagulation should be initiated while awaiting the results of diagnostic tests. This is usually done with subcutaneous, weightadjusted low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux (Supplementary Data Table 5 ), or i.v. unfractionated heparin (UFH).

Use of UFH is nowadays largely restricted to patients with overt haemodynamic instability or imminent haemodynamic decompensation in whom primary reperfusion treatment will be necessary.

In this group, patients with signs of RV dysfunction on echocardiography or CTPA (graphically presented in Figure 3 ), accompanied by a positive troponin test, should be monitored over the first hours or days due to the risk of early haemodynamic decompensation and circulatory collapse. 179 Routine primary reperfusion treatment, notably full-dose systemic thrombolysis, is not recommended, as the risk of potentially life-threatening bleeding complications appears too high for the expected benefits from this treatment. 179 Rescue thrombolytic therapy or, alternatively, surgical embolectomy or percutaneous catheter-directed treatment should be reserved for patients who develop signs of haemodynamic instability. In the PEITHO trial, the mean time between randomization and death or haemodynamic decompensation was 1.79 ± 1.60 days in the placebo (heparin-only) arm. 179 Therefore, it appears reasonable to leave patients with intermediate-high-risk PE on LMWH anticoagulation over the first 2 - 3 days and ensure that they remain stable before switching to oral anticoagulation.

            "Incidence estimates from cohort studies conducted more than 15 years ago reported an ~ 3% annual incidence of major bleeding in patients treated with VKAs. 345 Meta-analyses of phase III studies focusing on the first 3 - 12 months of anticoagulant treatment showed an ~ 40% reduction in the risk for major bleeding with NOACs compared with VKAs. 346 The risk of major bleeding is higher in the first month of anticoagulant treatment, and then declines and remains stable over time. Based on currently available evidence, risk factors include: (i) advanced age (particularly >75 years); (ii) previous bleeding (if not associated with a reversible or treatable cause) or anaemia; (iii) active cancer; (iv) previous stroke, either haemorrhagic or ischaemic; (v) chronic renal or hepatic disease; (vi) concomitant antiplatelet therapy or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (to be avoided, if possible); (vii) other serious acute or chronic illness; and (viii) poor anticoagulation control.  \nExisting bleeding risk scores and their current validation status are reviewed in Supplementary Data Table 14 . The patient's bleeding risk should be assessed, either by implicit judgement after evaluating individual risk factors or by the use of a bleeding risk score, at the time of initiation of anticoagulant treatment. It should be reassessed periodically (e.g. once a year in patients at low risk, and every 3 or 6 months in patients at high risk for bleeding). Bleeding risk assessment should be used to identify and treat modifiable bleeding risk factors, and it may influence decision-making on the duration and regimen/dose of anticoagulant treatment after acute PE.",

        "response": "In a hemodynamically stable patient with acute pulmonary embolism (PE), sPESI of 1, normal right ventricular (RV) function on echocardiography, and negative troponins, the risk stratification corresponds to intermediate-low risk PE. According to the guidelines, anticoagulation is the cornerstone of treatment in all PE patients without contraindications.\n\nHowever, this patient has a recent major gastrointestinal bleeding, which significantly increases the risk of anticoagulant-related bleeding complications. The guidelines emphasize assessing bleeding risk before initiating anticoagulation, considering factors such as recent bleeding, advanced age, and comorbidities. Major bleeding within a recent timeframe is a critical risk factor that may contraindicate or delay anticoagulation.\n\nThe guidelines do not provide a direct algorithm for anticoagulation initiation in patients with recent major bleeding but highlight the need for individualized risk-benefit assessment. In general, anticoagulation should be initiated in PE patients due to the high risk of thromboembolic complications, but in cases of recent major bleeding, the bleeding risk may outweigh the benefits temporarily.\n\nIf anticoagulation is deemed necessary, the choice of agent and dosing should consider bleeding risk. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux is preferred over unfractionated heparin (UFH) in stable patients due to lower bleeding risk. UFH may be preferred if rapid reversal is anticipated or if bleeding risk is very high, given its shorter half-life and reversibility. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have a lower risk of major bleeding compared to vitamin K antagonists but initiation in the setting of recent major bleeding requires caution.\n\nIn summary, for this patient:\n- Anticoagulation is generally indicated for PE.\n- Recent major gastrointestinal bleeding is a significant contraindication or caution for immediate anticoagulation.\n- A multidisciplinary evaluation is warranted to weigh the risks of recurrent PE versus bleeding.\n- If anticoagulation is initiated, careful selection of agent and close monitoring are essential.\n- Temporary withholding or delaying anticoagulation until bleeding is controlled may be considered, with mechanical prophylaxis or inferior vena cava filter placement as potential bridging strategies if bleeding risk is prohibitive.\n\nKey points: The presence of recent major gastrointestinal bleeding necessitates a careful individualized risk assessment before initiating anticoagulation in a hemodynamically stable PE patient with intermediate-low risk features. Anticoagulation should not be reflexively started without addressing bleeding risk and considering alternative or bridging strategies."

            "Acute RV failure with resulting low systemic output is the leading cause of death in patients with high-risk PE. The principles of acute right heart failure management have been reviewed in a statement from the Heart Failure Association and the Working Group on Pulmonary Circulation and Right Ventricular Function of the ESC. 68 An overview of the current treatment options for acute RV failure is provided in Table 9 .  \nIf the central venous pressure is low, modest (< \\_500 mL) fluid challenge can be used as it may increase the cardiac index in patients with acute PE. 238 However, volume loading has the potential to overdistend the RV and ultimately cause a reduction in systemic CO. 239 Experimental studies suggest that aggressive volume expansion is of no benefit and may even worsen RV function. 240 Cautious volume loading may be appropriate if low arterial pressure is combined with an absence of elevated filling pressures. Assessment of central venous pressure by ultrasound imaging of the IVC (a small and/or collapsible IVC in the setting of acute high-risk PE indicates low volume status) or, alternatively, by central venous pressure monitoring may help guide volume loading. If signs of elevated central venous pressure are observed, further volume loading should be withheld.  \nUse of vasopressors is often necessary, in parallel with (or while waiting for) pharmacological, surgical, or interventional reperfusion treatment. Norepinephrine can improve systemic haemodynamics by bringing about an improvement in ventricular systolic interaction and coronary perfusion, without causing a change in PVR. 240 Its use should be limited to patients in cardiogenic shock. Based on the results of a small series, the use of dobutamine may be considered for patients with PE, a low cardiac index, and normal BP; however, raising the cardiac index may aggravate the ventilation/perfusion mismatch by further redistributing flow from (partly) obstructed to unobstructed vessels. 241 Although experimental data suggest that levosimendan may restore RV - pulmonary arterial coupling in acute PE by combining pulmonary vasodilation with an increase in RV contractility, no evidence of clinical benefit is available.  \nVasodilators decrease PAP and PVR, but may worsen hypotension and systemic hypoperfusion due to their lack of specificity for the pulmonary vasculature after systemic [intravenous (i.v.)] administration. Although small clinical studies have suggested that inhalation of nitric oxide may improve the haemodynamic status and gas exchange of patients with PE, no evidence for its clinical efficacy or safety is available to date.",

            "Acute RV failure with resulting low systemic output is the leading cause of death in patients with high-risk PE. The principles of acute right heart failure management have been reviewed in a statement from the Heart Failure Association and the Working Group on Pulmonary Circulation and Right Ventricular Function of the ESC. 68 An overview of the current treatment options for acute RV failure is provided in Table 9 .  \nIf the central venous pressure is low, modest (< \\_500 mL) fluid challenge can be used as it may increase the cardiac index in patients with acute PE. 238 However, volume loading has the potential to overdistend the RV and ultimately cause a reduction in systemic CO. 239 Experimental studies suggest that aggressive volume expansion is of no benefit and may even worsen RV function. 240 Cautious volume loading may be appropriate if low arterial pressure is combined with an absence of elevated filling pressures. Assessment of central venous pressure by ultrasound imaging of the IVC (a small and/or collapsible IVC in the setting of acute high-risk PE indicates low volume status) or, alternatively, by central venous pressure monitoring may help guide volume loading. If signs of elevated central venous pressure are observed, further volume loading should be withheld.  \nUse of vasopressors is often necessary, in parallel with (or while waiting for) pharmacological, surgical, or interventional reperfusion treatment. Norepinephrine can improve systemic haemodynamics by bringing about an improvement in ventricular systolic interaction and coronary perfusion, without causing a change in PVR. 240 Its use should be limited to patients in cardiogenic shock. Based on the results of a small series, the use of dobutamine may be considered for patients with PE, a low cardiac index, and normal BP; however, raising the cardiac index may aggravate the ventilation/perfusion mismatch by further redistributing flow from (partly) obstructed to unobstructed vessels. 241 Although experimental data suggest that levosimendan may restore RV - pulmonary arterial coupling in acute PE by combining pulmonary vasodilation with an increase in RV contractility, no evidence of clinical benefit is available.  \nVasodilators decrease PAP and PVR, but may worsen hypotension and systemic hypoperfusion due to their lack of specificity for the pulmonary vasculature after systemic [intravenous (i.v.)] administration. Although small clinical studies have suggested that inhalation of nitric oxide may improve the haemodynamic status and gas exchange of patients with PE, no evidence for its clinical efficacy or safety is available to date.",

            "The temporary use of mechanical cardiopulmonary support, mostly with veno - arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), may be helpful in patients with high-risk PE, and circulatory collapse or cardiac arrest. Survival of critically ill patients has been described in a number of case series, 247 - 252 but no RCTs testing the efficacy and safety of these devices in the setting of high-risk PE have been conducted to date. Use of ECMO is associated with a high incidence of complications, even when used for short periods, and the results depend on the experience of the centre as well as patient selection. The increased risk of bleeding related to the need for vascular access should be considered, particularly in patients undergoing thrombolysis. At present, the use of ECMO as a stand-alone technique with anticoagulation is controversial 247,252 and additional therapies, such as surgical embolectomy, have to be considered.  \nA few cases suggesting good outcomes with use of the Impella V R catheter in patients in shock caused by acute PE have been reported. 253,254"

        "response": "In a patient with pulmonary embolism (PE) who has undergone systemic thrombolysis but remains hypotensive with persistent right ventricular (RV) dysfunction after 36 hours, treatment adjustment should focus on managing acute RV failure and hemodynamic instability.\n\n1. Volume Optimization: Assess central venous pressure (CVP) or inferior vena cava (IVC) status to guide cautious volume loading. If CVP is low or IVC is small and collapsible, a modest fluid challenge (<500 mL of saline or Ringer's lactate over 15-30 minutes) may improve cardiac output. However, avoid aggressive volume expansion as it can overdistend the RV, worsen ventricular interdependence, and reduce systemic cardiac output.\n\n2. Vasopressors and Inotropes: Use vasopressors such as norepinephrine to improve systemic blood pressure and RV function by enhancing ventricular interaction and coronary perfusion without increasing pulmonary vascular resistance. Norepinephrine is indicated especially in cardiogenic shock. Dobutamine may be considered if the patient has a low cardiac index but normal blood pressure; however, it should be used cautiously as it may worsen ventilation/perfusion mismatch and hypotension if used without a vasopressor.\n\n3. Mechanical Circulatory Support: In cases of refractory shock or circulatory collapse despite pharmacological support, veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can provide rapid short-term cardiopulmonary support. ECMO use requires an experienced center and consideration of bleeding risks, especially post-thrombolysis. ECMO alone is controversial and often combined with surgical embolectomy or other interventions.\n\n4. Additional Considerations: Vasodilators are generally not recommended due to the risk of worsening hypotension. Experimental therapies like levosimendan or inhaled nitric oxide lack sufficient evidence for routine clinical use.\n\nSummary: For persistent hypotension and RV dysfunction after systemic thrombolysis in high-risk PE, carefully optimize volume status, initiate vasopressor support (preferably norepinephrine), consider inotropes cautiously, and evaluate for mechanical circulatory support such as ECMO if refractory shock persists. These steps aim to stabilize hemodynamics while considering the risks of volume overload and bleeding."

The clinical probability is usually high and the differential diagnosis includes cardiac tamponade, acute coronary syndrome, aortic dissection, acute valvular dysfunction, and hypovolaemia. The most useful initial test in this situation is bedside TTE, which will yield evidence of acute RV dysfunction if acute PE is the cause of the patient's haemodynamic decompensation. In a highly unstable patient, echocardiographic evidence of RV dysfunction is sufficient to prompt immediate reperfusion without further testing. This decision may be strengthened by the (rare) visualization of right heart thrombi. 155,157,321,322 Ancillary bedside imaging tests include TOE, which may allow direct visualization of thrombi in the pulmonary artery and its main branches, especially in patients with RV dysfunction. TOE should be cautiously performed in hypoxaemic patients. Moreover, bedside CUS can detect proximal DVT. As soon as the patient is stabilized using supportive treatment, final confirmation of the diagnosis by CT angiography should be sought.  \nFor unstable patients admitted directly to the catheterization laboratory with suspected acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary angiography may be considered as a diagnostic procedure after the acute coronary syndrome has been excluded, provided that PE is a probable diagnostic alternative and particularly if percutaneous catheterdirected treatment is a therapeutic option.",

High-risk PE is defined by haemodynamic instability and encompasses the forms of clinical presentation shown in Table 4 .  \nAs an immediately life-threatening situation, high-risk PE requires an emergency diagnostic (upon suspicion) and therapeutic (upon confirmation or if the level of suspicion is sufficiently high) strategy, as outlined in section 7 .

        "response": "In a patient presenting with hemodynamic instability (hypotension) and echocardiographic evidence of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction (RV dilation and septal flattening), the guidelines clearly indicate that this clinical scenario defines high-risk pulmonary embolism (PE). According to the diagnostic and management algorithm for suspected high-risk PE, echocardiographic findings of RV dysfunction in the context of hemodynamic instability are sufficient to confirm the diagnosis of high-risk PE when immediate computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is not feasible or pending.\n\nIn such cases, the guidelines recommend initiating emergency reperfusion therapy without delay, even before confirmatory tests such as D-dimer or CTPA results are available. The rationale is that high-risk PE with hemodynamic compromise is an immediately life-threatening condition where the risk of delaying reperfusion treatment outweighs the risk of treatment-related complications. Systemic thrombolysis is the treatment of choice for reperfusion in this setting, with surgical or catheter-directed embolectomy as alternatives if thrombolysis is contraindicated or unavailable.\n\nTherefore, it is not appropriate to delay reperfusion treatment in this patient while awaiting D-dimer and CTPA results. Immediate thrombolytic therapy should be considered based on the clinical presentation and echocardiographic evidence of RV dysfunction, as this approach is supported by the guidelines to reduce early mortality in high-risk PE.\n\nSummary: In a hemodynamically unstable patient with echocardiographic signs of RV dysfunction, immediate reperfusion treatment (typically systemic thrombolysis) is indicated without waiting for confirmatory D-dimer or CTPA results, as per guideline recommendations for high-risk PE management."

            "As a general rule, early discharge of a patient with acute PE and continuation of anticoagulant treatment at home should be considered if three sets of criteria are fulfilled: (i) the risk of early PE-related death or serious complications is low ( section 5 ); (ii) there is no serious comorbidity or aggravating condition(s) (see section 5 )thatwould mandate hospitalization; and (iii) proper outpatient care and anticoagulant treatment can be provided, considering the patient's (anticipated) compliance, and the possibilities offered by the healthcare system and social infrastructure.  \nRandomized trials and prospective management cohort studies that investigated the feasibility and safety of early discharge, and home treatment, of PE adhered to these principles, even though slightly different criteria or combinations thereof were used to ensure the above three requirements.  \nThe Hestia exclusion criteria (Supplementary Data Table 12 ) represent a checklist of clinical parameters or questions that can be obtained/answered at the bedside. They integrate aspects of PE severity, comorbidity, and the feasibility of home treatment. If the answer to one or more of the questions is 'yes', then the patient cannot be discharged early. In a single-arm management trial that used these criteria to select candidates for home treatment, the 3 month rate of recurrent VTE was 2.0% (0.8 - 4.3%) in patients with acute PE who were discharged within 24 h. 317 In a subsequent non-inferiority trial that randomized 550 patients to direct discharge based on the Hestia criteria alone vs. additional NT-proBNP testing and discharge if levels were < \\_500 pg/mL, the primary outcome (30 day PE- or bleeding-related mortality, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or admission to an intensive care unit) was very low in both arms. The results suggest no incremental value of natriuretic-peptide testing in patients who are eligible for home treatment based on the Hestia criteria, although the study was not powered to exclude this possibility. 318  \nThe PESI and its simplified form, the sPESI ( Table 7 ), also integrate clinical parameters of PE severity and comorbidity to permit assessment of overall 30 day mortality. Compared with the Hestia criteria, the PESI is more standardized, but it contains a less-comprehensive list of aggravating conditions; moreover, the sPESI excludes all patients with cancer from the low-risk category (compare Table 7 with Supplementary Data Table 12 ). The PESI was not primarily developed as a tool to select candidates for home treatment, but it has been used-in combination with additional feasibility criteria-in a trial of 344 patients randomized to inpatient vs. outpatient treatment of PE. 178 One (0.6%) patient in each treatment group died within 90 days. 178  \nIn patients who were included in prospective cohort studies and treated at home, with or without a short hospitalization period, the 3 month rates of thromboembolic recurrence, major bleeding, and death were 1.75, 1.43, and 2.83%, respectively. 327  \nIn summary, the currently available evidence indicates that both the Hestia rule and the PESI or sPESI appear capable of reliably identifying patients who are (i) at low PE-related risk, and (ii) free of serious comorbidity. Consequently, either may be used for clinical triage according to local experience and preference. If a PESI- or sPESIbased approach is chosen, it must be combined with assessment of the feasibility of early discharge and home treatment; this assessment is already integrated into the Hestia criteria.  \nA more difficult decision related to immediate or early discharge is whether the exclusion of intermediate-risk PE on clinical grounds alone is adequate, or whether the assessment of RV dysfunction or myocardial injury (see section 5 )byanimagingtestora laboratory biomarker is necessary to provide maximal safety for the patient in this 'vulnerable' early period. A systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies suggested that the prognostic sensitivity is increased further when clinical criteria (e.g. PESI or sPESI) are combined with imaging findings, or laboratory biomarker levels. 234 A multicentre prospective management trial tested this hypothesis, investigating the efficacy and safety of early discharge, and ambulatory rivaroxaban treatment, in patients selected by clinical criteria and an absence of RV dysfunction.  \nOverall, ~ 20% of the screened unselected patients with PE were included. At the predefined interim analysis of 525 patients (50% of the planned population), the 3 month rate of symptomatic or fatal recurrent VTE was 0.6% (one-sided upper 99.6% CI 2.1%), permitting the early rejection of the null hypothesis and termination of the trial. Major bleeding occurred in six (1.2%) of the patients in the safety population. There were no PE-related deaths. 319 In view of the existing evidence-and taking into consideration (i) the catastrophic scenario of early death if a patient with acute PE is falsely judged to be at low risk on clinical grounds alone and discharged 'too early' (as described in a prematurely terminated trial), and (ii) the ease and minimal additional effort of assessing RV size and function at presentation by echocardiography, or on the CTPA performed to diagnose the PE event itself ( section 5 )-it is wise to exclude RV dysfunction and right heart thrombi if immediate or early (within the first 24 - 48 h) discharge of the patient is planned.",
            "The classification of PE severity and the risk of early (in-hospital or 30 day) death is summarized in Table 8 . Risk assessment of acute PE begins upon suspicion of the disease and initiation of the diagnostic workup. At this early stage, it is critical to identify patients with (suspected) high-risk PE. This clinical setting necessitates an emergency diagnostic algorithm ( Figure 4 ) and immediate referral for reperfusion treatment, as explained in section 7 , and displayed in Figure 6 and Supplementary Data Figure 1 . Testing for laboratory biomarkers such as cardiac troponins or natriuretic peptides is not necessary for immediate therapeutic decisions in patients with high-risk PE.  \nIn the absence of haemodynamic instability at presentation, further risk stratification of PE is recommended, as it has implications for early discharge vs. hospitalization or monitoring of the patient (explained in section 7 ). Table 8 provides an overview of the clinical, imaging, and laboratory parameters used to distinguish intermediateand low-risk PE. The PESI is-in its original or simplified form-the most extensively validated and most broadly used clinical score to date, as it integrates baseline indicators of the severity of the acute PE episode with aggravating conditions and the comorbidity of the patient. Overall, a PESI of class I - II or an sPESI of 0 is a reliable predictor of low-risk PE.  \nIn addition to clinical parameters, patients in the intermediate-risk group who display evidence of both RV dysfunction (on echocardiography or CTPA) and elevated cardiac biomarker levels in the circulation (particularly a positive cardiac troponin test) are classified into the intermediate-high-risk category. As will be discussed in more detail in section 7 , close monitoring is recommended in these cases to permit the early detection of haemodynamic decompensation or collapse, and consequently the need for rescue reperfusion therapy. 179 Patients in whom the RV appears normal on echocardiography or CTPA, and/or who have normal cardiac biomarker levels, belong to the intermediate-low-risk category. As an alternative approach, use of further prognostic scores combining clinical, imaging, and laboratory parameters may be considered to semi-quantitatively assess the severity of the PE episode, and distinguish intermediate-high-risk and intermediate-low-risk PE. Supplementary Data Table 4 lists the scores most frequently investigated for this purpose in observational (cohort) studies; however, none of them has been used in RCTs to date.  \nA recent meta-analysis included 21 cohort studies with a total of 3295 patients with 'low-risk' PE based on a PESI of I - II or an sPESI of 0. 234 Overall, 34% (95% CI 30 - 39%) of them were reported to have signs of RV dysfunction on echocardiography or CTPA. Data on early mortality were provided in seven studies (1597 patients) and revealed an OR of 4.19 (95% CI 1.39 - 12.58) for death from any cause in the presence of RV dysfunction; elevated cardiac troponin levels were associated with a comparable magnitude of risk elevation. 234 Early all-cause mortality rates (1.8% for RV dysfunction and 3.8% for elevated troponin levels) were in the lower range of those previously reported for patients with intermediate-risk PE. 235 Until the clinical implications of such discrepancies are clarified, patients with signs of RV dysfunction or elevated cardiac biomarkers, despite a low PESI or an sPESI of 0, should be classified into the intermediate-low-risk category.",
            "In addition to the clinical, imaging, and laboratory findings, which are directly linked to PE severity and PE-related early death, baseline parameters related to aggravating conditions and comorbidity are necessary to assess a patient's overall mortality risk and early outcome. Of the clinical scores integrating PE severity and comorbidity, the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) ( Table 7 ) is the one that has been most extensively validated to date. The principal strength of the PESI lies in the reliable identification of patients at low risk for 30 day mortality (PESI classes I and II). One randomized trial employed a low PESI as the principal inclusion criterion for home treatment of acute PE. 178  \nIn view of the complexity of the original PESI, which includes differently weighed variables, a simplified version (sPESI; Table 7) has been developed and validated. As with the original version of the PESI, the strength of the sPESI lies in the reliable identification of patients at low risk for 30 day mortality. The prognostic performance of the sPESI has been confirmed in observational cohort studies, although this index has not yet been prospectively used to guide therapeutic management of low-risk PE patients.  \nThe diagnosis of concomitant DVT has been identified as an adverse prognostic factor, being independently associated with death within the first 3 months after acute PE. In a meta-analysis investigating 8859 patients with PE, the presence of concomitant DVT was confirmed as a predictor of 30 day all-cause mortality (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.5 - 2.4), although it did not predict PE-related adverse outcomes at 90 days. Thus, concomitant DVT can be regarded as an indicator of significant comorbidity in acute PE.",

            "As a general rule, early discharge of a patient with acute PE and continuation of anticoagulant treatment at home should be considered if three sets of criteria are fulfilled: (i) the risk of early PE-related death or serious complications is low ( section 5 ); (ii) there is no serious comorbidity or aggravating condition(s) (see section 5 )thatwould mandate hospitalization; and (iii) proper outpatient care and anticoagulant treatment can be provided, considering the patient's (anticipated) compliance, and the possibilities offered by the healthcare system and social infrastructure.  \nRandomized trials and prospective management cohort studies that investigated the feasibility and safety of early discharge, and home treatment, of PE adhered to these principles, even though slightly different criteria or combinations thereof were used to ensure the above three requirements.  \nThe Hestia exclusion criteria (Supplementary Data Table 12 ) represent a checklist of clinical parameters or questions that can be obtained/answered at the bedside. They integrate aspects of PE severity, comorbidity, and the feasibility of home treatment. If the answer to one or more of the questions is 'yes', then the patient cannot be discharged early. In a single-arm management trial that used these criteria to select candidates for home treatment, the 3 month rate of recurrent VTE was 2.0% (0.8 - 4.3%) in patients with acute PE who were discharged within 24 h. 317 In a subsequent non-inferiority trial that randomized 550 patients to direct discharge based on the Hestia criteria alone vs. additional NT-proBNP testing and discharge if levels were < \\_500 pg/mL, the primary outcome (30 day PE- or bleeding-related mortality, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or admission to an intensive care unit) was very low in both arms. The results suggest no incremental value of natriuretic-peptide testing in patients who are eligible for home treatment based on the Hestia criteria, although the study was not powered to exclude this possibility. 318  \nThe PESI and its simplified form, the sPESI ( Table 7 ), also integrate clinical parameters of PE severity and comorbidity to permit assessment of overall 30 day mortality. Compared with the Hestia criteria, the PESI is more standardized, but it contains a less-comprehensive list of aggravating conditions; moreover, the sPESI excludes all patients with cancer from the low-risk category (compare Table 7 with Supplementary Data Table 12 ). The PESI was not primarily developed as a tool to select candidates for home treatment, but it has been used-in combination with additional feasibility criteria-in a trial of 344 patients randomized to inpatient vs. outpatient treatment of PE. 178 One (0.6%) patient in each treatment group died within 90 days. 178  \nIn patients who were included in prospective cohort studies and treated at home, with or without a short hospitalization period, the 3 month rates of thromboembolic recurrence, major bleeding, and death were 1.75, 1.43, and 2.83%, respectively. 327  \nIn summary, the currently available evidence indicates that both the Hestia rule and the PESI or sPESI appear capable of reliably identifying patients who are (i) at low PE-related risk, and (ii) free of serious comorbidity. Consequently, either may be used for clinical triage according to local experience and preference. If a PESI- or sPESIbased approach is chosen, it must be combined with assessment of the feasibility of early discharge and home treatment; this assessment is already integrated into the Hestia criteria.  \nA more difficult decision related to immediate or early discharge is whether the exclusion of intermediate-risk PE on clinical grounds alone is adequate, or whether the assessment of RV dysfunction or myocardial injury (see section 5 )byanimagingtestora laboratory biomarker is necessary to provide maximal safety for the patient in this 'vulnerable' early period. A systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies suggested that the prognostic sensitivity is increased further when clinical criteria (e.g. PESI or sPESI) are combined with imaging findings, or laboratory biomarker levels. 234 A multicentre prospective management trial tested this hypothesis, investigating the efficacy and safety of early discharge, and ambulatory rivaroxaban treatment, in patients selected by clinical criteria and an absence of RV dysfunction.  \nOverall, ~ 20% of the screened unselected patients with PE were included. At the predefined interim analysis of 525 patients (50% of the planned population), the 3 month rate of symptomatic or fatal recurrent VTE was 0.6% (one-sided upper 99.6% CI 2.1%), permitting the early rejection of the null hypothesis and termination of the trial. Major bleeding occurred in six (1.2%) of the patients in the safety population. There were no PE-related deaths. 319 In view of the existing evidence-and taking into consideration (i) the catastrophic scenario of early death if a patient with acute PE is falsely judged to be at low risk on clinical grounds alone and discharged 'too early' (as described in a prematurely terminated trial), and (ii) the ease and minimal additional effort of assessing RV size and function at presentation by echocardiography, or on the CTPA performed to diagnose the PE event itself ( section 5 )-it is wise to exclude RV dysfunction and right heart thrombi if immediate or early (within the first 24 - 48 h) discharge of the patient is planned.",

        "response": "Outpatient management of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) can be considered in patients who are clinically stable, at low risk of early PE-related death or serious complications, and free of serious comorbidities. The simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (sPESI) score of 0 and absence of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction indicate low-risk PE, which is a prerequisite for considering early discharge and home treatment.\n\nHowever, beyond clinical and imaging criteria, the feasibility of outpatient management critically depends on the patient's social circumstances and anticipated adherence to anticoagulant therapy. The guidelines emphasize that proper outpatient care and anticoagulant treatment must be ensured, taking into account the patient's expected compliance and the availability of social support and healthcare infrastructure. The Hestia criteria, which integrate clinical severity, comorbidity, and feasibility of home treatment, explicitly exclude patients who cannot guarantee safe outpatient management due to social or compliance issues.\n\nIn this case, although the patient is stable with sPESI = 0 and no RV dysfunction, the fact that the patient lives alone and has a history of poor adherence to medications represents a significant barrier to safe outpatient management. The guidelines recommend against early discharge if proper outpatient care cannot be assured, as poor adherence increases the risk of treatment failure, recurrent thromboembolism, and bleeding complications.\n\nTherefore, despite the low clinical risk profile, outpatient management is not appropriate for this patient due to the lack of social support and poor medication adherence history. Hospitalization is advised to ensure safe initiation and monitoring of anticoagulant therapy.\n\nSummary: Low-risk PE patients with sPESI = 0 and no RV dysfunction may be managed as outpatients if they have adequate social support and reliable medication adherence. In patients living alone with poor adherence history, inpatient management is recommended to ensure treatment safety."
