        "content": "FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n- Patient State:  \nA 45-year-old female patient with confirmed pulmonary embolism (PE) by CTPA. She is hemodynamically stable (SBP 120 mmHg, no hypoperfusion, no altered mental status), with normal renal function (CrCl 95 mL/min), no history of cancer, heart failure, or chronic cardiopulmonary disease. Echocardiography shows no right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, and RV/LV diameter ratio is <1. The Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) score is 45 (Class I), and simplified PESI (sPESI) is 0, indicating low early mortality risk. Oxygen saturation is mildly reduced at 90%. No absolute or relative contraindications to anticoagulation or thrombolysis are present.\n\n- Diagnosis:  \nConfirmed low-risk pulmonary embolism without hemodynamic instability or RV dysfunction.\n\n- Recommendations:  \n\n1. **Anticoagulation Initiation:**  \n   - Start anticoagulation immediately without delay. Given the patient’s stable status and normal renal function, initiation of a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC/NOAC) is recommended as first-line therapy.  \n   - Preferred agents include apixaban or rivaroxaban, given their favorable safety and efficacy profiles.  \n   - Suggested dosing:  \n     - **Apixaban:** 10 mg orally twice daily for 7 days, followed by 5 mg twice daily thereafter.  \n     - OR **Rivaroxaban:** 15 mg orally twice daily for 21 days, followed by 20 mg once daily thereafter.  \n   - If oral anticoagulation is not feasible initially, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux can be used as parenteral anticoagulation before switching to oral agents.  \n   - Avoid vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) unless DOACs are contraindicated or unavailable.\n\n2. **Outpatient Management and Early Discharge:**  \n   - Given the low-risk classification (PESI I, sPESI 0), absence of RV dysfunction, and no comorbidities or contraindications, the patient is a suitable candidate for early discharge and outpatient treatment.  \n   - Ensure the patient has adequate family or social support, reliable access to medical care, and the ability to adhere to anticoagulation therapy and follow-up.  \n   - Provide clear instructions on signs and symptoms of clinical deterioration (e.g., worsening dyspnea, chest pain, syncope) that warrant immediate medical attention.\n\n3. **Monitoring and Follow-up:**  \n   - Arrange close outpatient follow-up within 48-72 hours after discharge to reassess clinical status and adherence.  \n   - Consider repeating echocardiography or cardiac biomarkers (troponin, NT-proBNP) only if clinical status changes or if initial tests were unavailable and clinical suspicion of RV strain arises.  \n   - Routine troponin testing is not mandatory given low-risk status and absence of RV dysfunction, but may be considered if available to confirm risk stratification.\n\n4. **Avoidance of Thrombolysis:**  \n   - Routine systemic thrombolysis is not recommended in low-risk PE due to unfavorable risk-benefit ratio (Class III, Level B).  \n   - Thrombolytic therapy should be reserved only for patients who develop hemodynamic deterioration during anticoagulation treatment.\n\n5. **Precautions:**  \n   - Monitor for bleeding complications during anticoagulation therapy, although no contraindications are present.  \n   - Educate patient regarding adherence, potential drug interactions, and bleeding risk.\n\n- Summary:  \nThis patient has a confirmed low-risk pulmonary embolism with stable hemodynamics, no RV dysfunction, and low PESI/sPESI scores. Immediate initiation of anticoagulation with a DOAC (apixaban or rivaroxaban) is recommended, with consideration for early discharge and outpatient management given the patient’s low-risk profile and absence of contraindications. Close outpatient follow-up is essential to ensure safety and treatment adherence. Routine thrombolysis is contraindicated in this setting. This approach aligns with current evidence-based guidelines prioritizing patient safety, efficacy, and resource optimization.",

                "content": "For most cases of acute PE without haemodynamic compromise, parenteral or oral anticoagulation (without reperfusion techniques) is adequate treatment. As shown in Figure 6 , normotensive patients with at least one indicator of elevated PE-related risk, or with aggravating conditions or comorbidity, should be hospitalized. In this group, patients with signs of RV dysfunction on echocardiography or CTPA (graphically presented in Figure 3 ), accompanied by a positive troponin test, should be monitored over the first hours or days due to the risk of early haemodynamic decompensation and circulatory collapse. 179 Routine primary reperfusion treatment, notably full-dose systemic thrombolysis, is not recommended, as the risk of potentially life-threatening bleeding complications appears too high for the expected benefits from this treatment. 179 Rescue thrombolytic therapy or, alternatively, surgical embolectomy or percutaneous catheter-directed treatment should be reserved for patients who develop signs of haemodynamic instability. In the PEITHO trial, the mean time between randomization and death or haemodynamic decompensation was 1.79 ± 1.60 days in the placebo (heparin-only) arm. 179 Therefore, it appears reasonable to leave patients with intermediate-high-risk PE on LMWH anticoagulation over the first 2 - 3 days and ensure that they remain stable before switching to oral anticoagulation. As mentioned in the previous section, the specifications concerning the increased initial dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban, or the minimum overall period of heparin anticoagulation before switching to dabigatran or edoxaban, must be followed.  \nSuggestions for the anticoagulation and overall management of acute PE in specific clinical situations, for which conclusive evidence is lacking, are presented in Supplementary Data Table 9 .",

        "content": "FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n- Patient State:  \nA 67-year-old male patient with a history of cancer and chronic cardiopulmonary disease, presenting with clinical signs of hemodynamic instability: systolic blood pressure 97 mmHg (borderline hypotension), heart rate 127 bpm (tachycardia), respiratory rate 45/min (severe tachypnea), oxygen saturation 89%, and evidence of hypoperfusion. PESI score is very high (207, Class V), and sPESI is high (5), indicating a high risk of early mortality. There is no available imaging (echocardiography or CTPA) or laboratory data (troponin, NT-proBNP, renal function) to confirm right ventricular dysfunction or PE diagnosis. The patient has an absolute contraindication to thrombolysis due to recent major surgery (within 3 weeks).\n\n- Diagnosis:  \nSuspected high-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) with hemodynamic instability. The clinical presentation strongly suggests high-risk PE, but confirmatory imaging and laboratory tests are currently unavailable. The patient is unstable, requiring urgent diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.\n\n- Recommendations:\n\n1. **Immediate Diagnostic Workup:**\n\n   - **Bedside Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE):**  \n     Urgently perform bedside TTE to assess for right ventricular (RV) dysfunction (e.g., RV dilation, RV/LV ratio >1.0, McConnell sign, TAPSE <16 mm) and to exclude alternative causes of shock. This is critical as echocardiographic evidence of RV dysfunction in an unstable patient with suspected PE justifies emergency reperfusion therapy.  \n     *(Class I, Level C)*\n\n   - **Bilateral Venous Compression Ultrasonography (CUS):**  \n     Perform bedside bilateral lower limb venous CUS to detect proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which supports the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism and may guide urgent management if CTPA is not feasible.  \n     *(Class I, Level C)*\n\n   - **CT Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA):**  \n     If the patient stabilizes sufficiently or if bedside imaging is inconclusive, perform CTPA as soon as possible to confirm PE diagnosis and assess RV/LV ratio. However, if the patient’s condition is too critical to transfer, do not delay treatment based on inability to perform CTPA.  \n     *(Class I, Level C)*\n\n   - **Laboratory Tests:**  \n     Obtain cardiac biomarkers (troponin, NT-proBNP) and renal function tests to assist risk stratification and guide anticoagulation dosing.  \n     *(Class I, Level C)*\n\n2. **Therapeutic Management:**\n\n   - **Anticoagulation:**  \n     Initiate anticoagulation immediately with intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) including a weight-adjusted bolus (e.g., 80 units/kg bolus followed by continuous infusion at 18 units/kg/hr, adjusted by aPTT), unless active bleeding or other contraindications develop. UFH is preferred due to its short half-life and reversibility, especially important given recent surgery.  \n     *(Class I, Level C)*\n\n   - **Reperfusion Therapy:**  \n     Systemic thrombolysis is contraindicated due to recent major surgery (absolute contraindication). Therefore, consider alternative reperfusion strategies:  \n     - **Surgical Pulmonary Embolectomy:**  \n       If expertise and resources are available, surgical embolectomy is recommended as first-line reperfusion therapy in this patient with high-risk PE and contraindication to thrombolysis.  \n       *(Class I, Level C)*  \n     - **Percutaneous Catheter-Directed Treatment:**  \n       If surgical embolectomy is not feasible or available, catheter-directed thrombus removal or fragmentation should be considered as an alternative reperfusion option.  \n       *(Class IIa, Level C)*\n\n   - **Hemodynamic Support:**  \n     Initiate vasopressor support with norepinephrine to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (target MAP ≥ 65 mmHg). Dobutamine may be added if there is evidence of RV failure with low cardiac output.  \n     *(Class IIa, Level C)*\n\n   - **Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO):**  \n     Consider ECMO as a bridge to surgical or catheter-directed reperfusion in case of refractory circulatory collapse or cardiac arrest, if available.  \n     *(Class IIb, Level C)*\n\n3. **Monitoring and Follow-up:**\n\n   - Continuous hemodynamic and respiratory monitoring in an intensive care setting is mandatory.  \n   - After reperfusion and stabilization, transition to long-term anticoagulation should be planned, considering the patient’s cancer status and renal function once available.  \n   - Given the patient’s cancer history, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) may be considered after stabilization, following current oncologic thrombosis guidelines and renal function assessment.\n\n- Summary:  \nThis patient presents with suspected high-risk PE and hemodynamic instability, compounded by recent major surgery contraindicating systemic thrombolysis. Immediate bedside echocardiography and venous ultrasonography are essential to confirm RV dysfunction and DVT, guiding urgent management. Anticoagulation with UFH should be started without delay. Given the absolute contraindication to thrombolysis, surgical pulmonary embolectomy is the preferred reperfusion strategy if available; otherwise, catheter-directed treatment is a reasonable alternative. Hemodynamic support with vasopressors is critical. Close monitoring in ICU and prompt diagnostic confirmation with CTPA when feasible are necessary. This approach balances the urgent need for reperfusion with the patient’s bleeding risk and clinical instability.",

Accordingly, clinical symptoms, and signs of overt RV failure and haemodynamic instability, indicate a high risk of early (in-hospital or 30 day) mortality. High-risk PE is defined by haemodynamic instability and encompasses the forms of clinical presentation shown in Table 4 .  \nAs an immediately life-threatening situation, high-risk PE requires an emergency diagnostic (upon suspicion) and therapeutic (upon confirmation or if the level of suspicion is sufficiently high) strategy, as outlined in section 7 . However, the absence of haemodynamic instability does not exclude beginning (and possibly progressing) RV dysfunction, and thus an elevated PE-related early risk. In this large population, further assessment (outlined in sections 5 and 7 ) is necessary to determine the level of risk and adjust management decisions accordingly.",

She is normotensive (SBP 100 mmHg, DBP 50 mmHg), tachycardic (HR 111 bpm), mildly tachypneic (RR 24/min), and oxygen saturation 94%. Echocardiography shows right ventricular (RV) dysfunction (TAPSE 10 mm, McConnell sign positive, IVC diameter 2.7 cm with no inspiratory collapsibility, peak systolic velocity of tricuspid annulus <9.5 cm/s). CTPA confirms RV/LV diameter ratio >1. Troponin is elevated. Renal function is normal (CrCl 120 mL/min). PESI score is low (class I, value 38), but sPESI is 1 (high risk). Overall, the patient is classified as intermediate-high risk PE with no haemodynamic instability. Absolute contraindications to thrombolysis are absent; pregnancy is a relative contraindication.\n\n- Diagnosis:  \nConfirmed acute intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism in a pregnant patient without haemodynamic instability but with evidence of RV dysfunction and myocardial injury (elevated troponin).\n\n- Recommendations:  \n\n1. **Hospitalization and Monitoring:**  \n   - Admit the patient for close clinical and hemodynamic monitoring in a setting capable of rapid intervention should haemodynamic deterioration occur.  \n   - Continuous monitoring of vital signs, oxygen saturation, and clinical status is essential during the initial 48-72 hours due to the risk of early haemodynamic decompensation.\n\n2. **Anticoagulation Therapy:**  \n   - Initiate therapeutic anticoagulation with weight-adjusted low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), the preferred anticoagulant in pregnancy due to safety profile and lack of placental transfer.  \n   - Suggested dosing: Enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours (i.e., 50 mg every 12 hours), adjusted to patient weight and renal function (CrCl 120 mL/min is normal, no dose adjustment needed).  \n   - Avoid vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) during pregnancy due to teratogenicity and lack of safety data.  \n   - Routine anti-Xa monitoring is not required unless there are concerns about absorption or extremes of body weight.\n\n3. **Avoidance of Primary Systemic Thrombolysis:**  \n   - Given the patient’s intermediate-high risk status without haemodynamic instability and pregnancy as a relative contraindication, systemic thrombolysis is **not recommended** due to high bleeding risk and potential fetal harm.  \n   - Thrombolytic therapy should be reserved only as rescue treatment if the patient develops haemodynamic instability or circulatory collapse.\n\n4. **Consideration of Alternative Reperfusion Therapies:**  \n   - If haemodynamic deterioration occurs and thrombolysis is contraindicated or not feasible, consider surgical pulmonary embolectomy or percutaneous catheter-directed therapies, provided expertise and resources are available.  \n   - These options should be discussed with a multidisciplinary team including cardiology, pulmonology, obstetrics, and cardiothoracic surgery.\n\n5. **Further Diagnostic and Monitoring Tests:**  \n   - Repeat echocardiography as clinically indicated to monitor RV function and detect early signs of deterioration.  \n   - Continuous fetal monitoring should be performed in collaboration with obstetrics.  \n   - No immediate need for additional imaging unless clinical status changes.\n\n6. **Transition of Anticoagulation:**  \n   - Continue LMWH throughout pregnancy.  \n   - Postpartum anticoagulation management should be planned in advance, considering the safety profile of anticoagulants in breastfeeding and postpartum period.\n\n7. **Patient Counseling and Precautions:**  \n   - Educate the patient about signs of clinical deterioration (e.g., worsening dyspnea, chest pain, syncope) requiring urgent medical attention.  \n   - Emphasize adherence to anticoagulation and follow-up appointments.\n\n- Summary:  \nThis young pregnant patient has confirmed intermediate-high risk PE with RV dysfunction and elevated troponin but remains haemodynamically stable. The safest and evidence-based approach is hospitalization with close monitoring and initiation of therapeutic LMWH anticoagulation. Systemic thrombolysis is contraindicated as primary therapy due to pregnancy and bleeding risk but should be reserved as rescue therapy if haemodynamic instability develops. Alternative reperfusion options may be considered if deterioration occurs and thrombolysis is contraindicated. Close multidisciplinary management including obstetrics is essential to optimize maternal and fetal outcomes.",

As shown in Figure 6 , normotensive patients with at least one indicator of elevated PE-related risk, or with aggravating conditions or comorbidity, should be hospitalized. In this group, patients with signs of RV dysfunction on echocardiography or CTPA (graphically presented in Figure 3 ), accompanied by a positive troponin test, should be monitored over the first hours or days due to the risk of early haemodynamic decompensation and circulatory collapse. 179 Routine primary reperfusion treatment, notably full-dose systemic thrombolysis, is not recommended, as the risk of potentially life-threatening bleeding complications appears too high for the expected benefits from this treatment. 179 Rescue thrombolytic therapy or, alternatively, surgical embolectomy or percutaneous catheter-directed treatment should be reserved for patients who develop signs of haemodynamic instability. In the PEITHO trial, the mean time between randomization and death or haemodynamic decompensation was 1.79 ± 1.60 days in the placebo (heparin-only) arm. 179 Therefore, it appears reasonable to leave patients with intermediate-high-risk PE on LMWH anticoagulation over the first 2 - 3 days and ensure that they remain stable before switching to oral anticoagulation. As mentioned in the previous section, the specifications concerning the increased initial dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban, or the minimum overall period of heparin anticoagulation before switching to dabigatran or edoxaban, must be followed.  \nSuggestions for the anticoagulation and overall management of acute PE in specific clinical situations, for which conclusive evidence is lacking, are presented in Supplementary Data Table 9 .",

Based on pharmacokinetic data (Supplementary Data Table 6 ), 259 an equally rapid anticoagulant effect can also be achieved with a nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), and phase III clinical trials have demonstrated the non-inferior efficacy of a single-oral drug anticoagulation strategy using higher doses of apixaban for 7 days or rivaroxaban for 3 weeks. 259 - 261  \nLMWH and fondaparinux are preferred over UFH for initial anticoagulation in PE, as they carry a lower risk of inducing major bleeding and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. 262 - 265 Neither LMWH nor fondaparinux need routine monitoring of anti-Xa levels. Use of UFH is nowadays largely restricted to patients with overt haemodynamic instability or imminent haemodynamic decompensation in whom primary reperfusion treatment will be necessary. UFH is also recommended for patients with serious renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CrCl) < \\_30 mL/min] or severe obesity.

        "content": "FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n- Patient State:  \nA 32-year-old female patient, weighing 80 kg and 160 cm tall, presenting with haemodynamic instability characterized by persistent hypotension (SBP 73 mmHg, DBP 35 mmHg), tachycardia (HR 143 bpm), tachypnea (RR 35/min), hypoperfusion signs, and hypoxemia (O2 saturation 87%). She has no history of cancer, heart failure, or chronic cardiopulmonary disease. Laboratory tests show elevated NT-proBNP but normal troponin. CTPA is negative for pulmonary embolism. Echocardiographic parameters are not available. The patient has an absolute contraindication to systemic thrombolysis due to recent major trauma within the last 3 weeks. PESI and sPESI scores indicate very high clinical risk (PESI Class V, sPESI 3).\n\n- Diagnosis:  \nSuspected high-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) with haemodynamic instability (persistent hypotension and hypoperfusion), despite a negative CTPA. The negative CTPA does not exclude PE in this unstable patient, especially given the lack of echocardiographic data and the clinical presentation consistent with obstructive shock. The absence of RV dysfunction data is a critical gap. Other causes of shock should be considered but PE remains a leading differential diagnosis given clinical context.\n\n- Recommendations:\n\n1. **Urgent Bedside Diagnostic Evaluation:**\n   - Perform an immediate bedside transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) to assess for right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, RV/LV diameter ratio, McConnell sign, and presence of right heart thrombi.  \n     - Rationale: In unstable patients with suspected high-risk PE and negative CTPA, echocardiographic evidence of RV dysfunction is crucial to confirm diagnosis and guide therapy (Class I, Level C).  \n     - If TTE is inconclusive or unavailable, consider transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) cautiously, balancing hypoxemia risk, to detect thrombi in pulmonary arteries or right heart.\n\n   - Perform bilateral lower limb venous compression ultrasonography (CUS) to detect proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which would support the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and PE.\n\n2. **Treatment:**\n\n   - **Anticoagulation:**  \n     - Initiate immediate anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin (UFH) with a weight-adjusted bolus followed by continuous infusion, targeting an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 1.5–2.5 times control.  \n     - Rationale: UFH is recommended without delay in high-risk PE patients (Class I, Level C). UFH is preferred here due to the ability to rapidly reverse anticoagulation if bleeding occurs, especially given recent major trauma.\n\n   - **Reperfusion Therapy:**  \n     - Systemic thrombolysis is contraindicated due to recent major trauma (absolute contraindication).  \n     - Therefore, **surgical pulmonary embolectomy** or **percutaneous catheter-directed treatment** should be considered as alternative reperfusion strategies if expertise and resources are available on-site (Class I and IIa, Level C).  \n     - Early consultation with cardiothoracic surgery and interventional radiology teams is essential to evaluate candidacy for these procedures.\n\n   - **Hemodynamic Support:**  \n     - Initiate vasopressor support with norepinephrine to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP ≥ 65 mmHg). Consider dobutamine if there is evidence of RV failure with low cardiac output (Class IIa, Level C).  \n     - Provide supplemental oxygen and consider advanced respiratory support as needed.\n\n   - **Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO):**  \n     - If refractory circulatory collapse or cardiac arrest occurs, ECMO may be considered as a bridge to surgical or catheter-directed reperfusion (Class IIb, Level C).\n\n3. **Further Diagnostic Confirmation and Monitoring:**\n   - Once the patient is hemodynamically stabilized, repeat imaging with CTPA or pulmonary angiography should be pursued to confirm diagnosis and guide ongoing management.  \n   - Continuous clinical monitoring in an intensive care setting is mandatory.\n\n4. **Precautions and Notes:**\n   - Avoid systemic thrombolysis due to absolute contraindication (recent major trauma).  \n   - UFH is preferred over low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) initially due to reversibility and short half-life.  \n   - Close monitoring for bleeding complications is essential given anticoagulation in the context of recent trauma.  \n   - If echocardiography does not show RV dysfunction and no DVT is found, reassess for alternative causes of shock urgently.\n\n- Summary:  \nThis young female patient presents with clinical and hemodynamic features consistent with high-risk PE despite a negative CTPA. Immediate bedside echocardiography and venous ultrasound are critical to confirm RV dysfunction and DVT, respectively. Anticoagulation with UFH should be started promptly. Due to an absolute contraindication to systemic thrombolysis (recent major trauma), alternative reperfusion strategies such as surgical embolectomy or catheter-directed therapy must be urgently considered. Hemodynamic support with vasopressors is essential. Close monitoring in ICU and repeat imaging after stabilization are mandatory. Avoid under-treatment given the high mortality risk associated with untreated high-risk PE.",

Accordingly, clinical symptoms, and signs of overt RV failure and haemodynamic instability, indicate a high risk of early (in-hospital or 30 day) mortality. High-risk PE is defined by haemodynamic instability and encompasses the forms of clinical presentation shown in Table 4 .  \nAs an immediately life-threatening situation, high-risk PE requires an emergency diagnostic (upon suspicion) and therapeutic (upon confirmation or if the level of suspicion is sufficiently high) strategy, as outlined in section 7 . However, the absence of haemodynamic instability does not exclude beginning (and possibly progressing) RV dysfunction, and thus an elevated PE-related early risk. In this large population, further assessment (outlined in sections 5 and 7 ) is necessary to determine the level of risk and adjust management decisions accordingly.",

        "content": "FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n- Patient State:  \n54-year-old male patient with confirmed acute pulmonary embolism (PE) by CTPA. The patient is hemodynamically stable (SBP 137 mmHg, no hypoperfusion, normal mental status), with elevated cardiac biomarkers (troponin and NT-proBNP elevated), indicating myocardial injury and strain. PESI score is 64 (Class I), and sPESI is 0 (low risk). Echocardiographic parameters assessing right ventricular (RV) dysfunction are not available. Creatinine clearance is 67 mL/min, indicating mild renal impairment but sufficient for standard anticoagulation dosing. No absolute or relative contraindications to anticoagulation or thrombolysis are present.\n\n- Diagnosis:  \nConfirmed acute pulmonary embolism without hemodynamic instability. The patient falls into the intermediate-risk category due to elevated troponin and biomarker evidence of myocardial strain, but RV dysfunction status is unknown due to unavailable echocardiographic data.\n\n- Recommendations:\n\n1. **Hospitalization and Monitoring:**  \n   Given the presence of elevated troponin and confirmed PE, the patient should be hospitalized for close clinical and hemodynamic monitoring over the first 48-72 hours to detect any early signs of hemodynamic deterioration or circulatory collapse. This is consistent with intermediate-risk PE management guidelines (Class I recommendation).\n\n2. **Further Cardiac Imaging:**  \n   It is strongly recommended to perform transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) promptly to assess for RV dysfunction (e.g., RV enlargement, RV/LV ratio >1, McConnell sign, TAPSE <16 mm, or other signs as per Figure 3 in guidelines). This information is critical for risk stratification and may influence escalation of care if deterioration occurs.\n\n3. **Anticoagulation Therapy:**  \n   - Initiate parenteral anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), e.g., enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours (approximately 73 kg → 73 mg BID), adjusted for renal function if needed.  \n   - Continue LMWH for at least the first 2-3 days while monitoring clinical stability.  \n   - After ensuring hemodynamic stability and no clinical deterioration, transition to oral anticoagulation is appropriate.  \n   - Oral anticoagulant options include:  \n     - Apixaban: 10 mg orally twice daily for 7 days, then 5 mg twice daily.  \n     - Rivaroxaban: 15 mg orally twice daily for 21 days, then 20 mg once daily.  \n     - Alternatively, after at least 5 days of parenteral anticoagulation, dabigatran or edoxaban can be started at standard doses.  \n   - Choice of oral anticoagulant should consider patient preference, renal function, and drug availability.\n\n4. **Avoidance of Routine Systemic Thrombolysis:**  \n   - Routine full-dose systemic thrombolysis is **not recommended** in this patient due to stable hemodynamics and the increased risk of major bleeding outweighing benefits (Class III recommendation against routine use).  \n   - Rescue thrombolysis or alternative reperfusion therapies (surgical embolectomy or catheter-directed treatment) should be reserved only if the patient develops signs of hemodynamic instability or clinical deterioration.\n\n5. **Supportive Care and Monitoring:**  \n   - Monitor vital signs, oxygen saturation, and clinical status frequently.  \n   - Provide supplemental oxygen if saturation falls below 90%.  \n   - Monitor renal function and bleeding parameters regularly.  \n   - Assess for any new contraindications or complications during hospitalization.\n\n6. **Patient Education and Follow-up:**  \n   - Educate the patient about signs of clinical worsening (e.g., sudden dyspnea, chest pain, syncope).  \n   - Arrange close outpatient follow-up after discharge to monitor anticoagulation efficacy and safety.\n\n- Summary:  \nThis 54-year-old male with confirmed intermediate-risk PE (elevated troponin, stable hemodynamics) requires hospitalization and close monitoring. Immediate initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation with LMWH is indicated, with transition to oral anticoagulants after clinical stability is confirmed. Echocardiographic assessment of RV function is essential to refine risk stratification and guide management. Routine systemic thrombolysis is contraindicated in the absence of hemodynamic compromise due to bleeding risk. Rescue reperfusion therapies should be reserved for clinical deterioration. This approach aligns with current evidence-based guidelines and prioritizes patient safety.",

                "content": "For most cases of acute PE without haemodynamic compromise, parenteral or oral anticoagulation (without reperfusion techniques) is adequate treatment. As shown in Figure 6 , normotensive patients with at least one indicator of elevated PE-related risk, or with aggravating conditions or comorbidity, should be hospitalized. In this group, patients with signs of RV dysfunction on echocardiography or CTPA (graphically presented in Figure 3 ), accompanied by a positive troponin test, should be monitored over the first hours or days due to the risk of early haemodynamic decompensation and circulatory collapse. 179 Routine primary reperfusion treatment, notably full-dose systemic thrombolysis, is not recommended, as the risk of potentially life-threatening bleeding complications appears too high for the expected benefits from this treatment. 179 Rescue thrombolytic therapy or, alternatively, surgical embolectomy or percutaneous catheter-directed treatment should be reserved for patients who develop signs of haemodynamic instability. In the PEITHO trial, the mean time between randomization and death or haemodynamic decompensation was 1.79 ± 1.60 days in the placebo (heparin-only) arm. 179 Therefore, it appears reasonable to leave patients with intermediate-high-risk PE on LMWH anticoagulation over the first 2 - 3 days and ensure that they remain stable before switching to oral anticoagulation. As mentioned in the previous section, the specifications concerning the increased initial dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban, or the minimum overall period of heparin anticoagulation before switching to dabigatran or edoxaban, must be followed.  \nSuggestions for the anticoagulation and overall management of acute PE in specific clinical situations, for which conclusive evidence is lacking, are presented in Supplementary Data Table 9 .",

        "content": "FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n- Patient State:  \n78-year-old male patient with a history of cancer, no heart failure or chronic cardiopulmonary disease. Vital signs show hemodynamic stability (SBP 116 mmHg, HR 87 bpm, RR 19/min, SpO2 91%, no hypoperfusion or altered mental status). Laboratory tests reveal elevated troponin, creatinine 0.54 mg/dL with CrCl 76 mL/min. Echocardiographic and CTPA data regarding RV dysfunction and PE confirmation are not available. Clinical risk scores indicate intermediate-high risk (PESI class IV, sPESI = 1). No absolute or relative contraindications to anticoagulation or thrombolysis are present.\n\n- Diagnosis:  \nSuspected pulmonary embolism without hemodynamic instability but with intermediate-high risk features (elevated troponin, PESI IV, sPESI 1). The diagnosis of PE is not yet confirmed due to unavailable imaging (CTPA and echocardiography). The patient is currently stable but at risk for early hemodynamic deterioration.\n\n- Recommendations:\n\n1. **Diagnostic Workup:**\n\n   - **Urgently perform computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA)** to confirm or exclude pulmonary embolism. This is essential given the intermediate-high risk profile and elevated troponin, to guide definitive management.  \n   - **Perform transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** as soon as possible to assess for right ventricular (RV) dysfunction (e.g., RV/LV ratio >1.0, TAPSE <16 mm, McConnell sign). This will help refine risk stratification and guide monitoring intensity.  \n   - If CTPA is contraindicated or not feasible, consider **bilateral lower limb compression ultrasonography (CUS)** to detect proximal deep vein thrombosis as indirect evidence supporting PE diagnosis.  \n   - Monitor oxygen saturation and clinical status closely during diagnostic evaluation.\n\n2. **Initial Treatment:**\n\n   - **Start anticoagulation immediately with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)**, given the high clinical suspicion and elevated troponin, unless contraindications develop.  \n     - Suggested dosing: Enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours (approximately 74 mg BID based on 74 kg weight).  \n     - Monitor renal function and adjust dosing if CrCl falls below 30 mL/min (not currently the case).  \n   - Avoid systemic thrombolysis at this stage because the patient is hemodynamically stable and has no absolute contraindications but is classified as intermediate-high risk. Routine primary reperfusion is not recommended due to bleeding risk outweighing benefits in stable patients.  \n   - Hospitalize the patient for close monitoring in a setting capable of rapid intervention should hemodynamic deterioration occur.\n\n3. **Monitoring and Further Management:**\n\n   - Continuous clinical monitoring for signs of hemodynamic instability or RV failure (e.g., hypotension, shock, worsening hypoxia).  \n   - Repeat echocardiography if clinical status worsens to reassess RV function.  \n   - If the patient develops hemodynamic instability or signs of circulatory collapse, consider rescue reperfusion therapy:  \n     - Systemic thrombolysis if no contraindications.  \n     - If contraindications to thrombolysis arise, consider surgical pulmonary embolectomy or percutaneous catheter-directed therapy if available.  \n   - After at least 2–3 days of stable anticoagulation with LMWH, consider transition to oral anticoagulation:  \n     - Options include apixaban or rivaroxaban with initial higher dosing regimens (e.g., apixaban 10 mg BID for 7 days, then 5 mg BID; rivaroxaban 15 mg BID for 21 days, then 20 mg daily).  \n     - Alternatively, after minimum 5 days of LMWH, switch to dabigatran or edoxaban per approved protocols.  \n   - Given the patient’s cancer history, LMWH is preferred initially; however, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) may be considered based on cancer type, bleeding risk, and drug interactions.\n\n4. **Precautions:**\n\n   - Monitor for bleeding complications during anticoagulation, especially given cancer history.  \n   - Maintain vigilance for any signs of clinical deterioration.  \n   - Ensure supportive care including oxygen supplementation to maintain adequate saturation.  \n   - Avoid premature discharge; ensure social support and access to medical care if outpatient management is considered later.\n\n- Summary:  \nThis 78-year-old male with cancer and suspected intermediate-high risk PE (elevated troponin, PESI IV, stable hemodynamics) requires urgent diagnostic confirmation with CTPA and echocardiography to assess RV function. Immediate anticoagulation with LMWH is indicated while awaiting imaging results. Systemic thrombolysis is not recommended at this stage due to stable hemodynamics and bleeding risk. The patient should be hospitalized for close monitoring, with readiness to escalate to reperfusion therapy if hemodynamic instability develops. Transition to oral anticoagulation should follow clinical stabilization and guideline-based dosing. Close monitoring for bleeding and clinical deterioration is essential given the patient’s comorbidities and risk profile.",

                "content": "For most cases of acute PE without haemodynamic compromise, parenteral or oral anticoagulation (without reperfusion techniques) is adequate treatment. As shown in Figure 6 , normotensive patients with at least one indicator of elevated PE-related risk, or with aggravating conditions or comorbidity, should be hospitalized. In this group, patients with signs of RV dysfunction on echocardiography or CTPA (graphically presented in Figure 3 ), accompanied by a positive troponin test, should be monitored over the first hours or days due to the risk of early haemodynamic decompensation and circulatory collapse. 179 Routine primary reperfusion treatment, notably full-dose systemic thrombolysis, is not recommended, as the risk of potentially life-threatening bleeding complications appears too high for the expected benefits from this treatment. 179 Rescue thrombolytic therapy or, alternatively, surgical embolectomy or percutaneous catheter-directed treatment should be reserved for patients who develop signs of haemodynamic instability. In the PEITHO trial, the mean time between randomization and death or haemodynamic decompensation was 1.79 ± 1.60 days in the placebo (heparin-only) arm. 179 Therefore, it appears reasonable to leave patients with intermediate-high-risk PE on LMWH anticoagulation over the first 2 - 3 days and ensure that they remain stable before switching to oral anticoagulation. As mentioned in the previous section, the specifications concerning the increased initial dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban, or the minimum overall period of heparin anticoagulation before switching to dabigatran or edoxaban, must be followed.  \nSuggestions for the anticoagulation and overall management of acute PE in specific clinical situations, for which conclusive evidence is lacking, are presented in Supplementary Data Table 9 .",

        "content": "FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n- Patient State:  \nA 47-year-old male patient with confirmed pulmonary embolism (PE) presenting with hemodynamic instability characterized by persistent hypotension (SBP 93 mmHg, DBP 46 mmHg), signs of hypoperfusion (altered mental status, Glasgow Coma Scale 14), tachycardia (HR 153 bpm), tachypnea (RR 42/min), and oxygen saturation 93%. CTPA confirms PE with RV/LV diameter ratio >1 and contrast reflux into the inferior vena cava, indicating right ventricular dysfunction. Laboratory tests show elevated troponin and NT-proBNP, consistent with myocardial injury and RV strain. Renal function is preserved (CrCl 93 mL/min). PESI score is 187 (Class V), and sPESI is 2 (high risk), indicating a high early mortality risk.\n\n- Diagnosis:  \nConfirmed high-risk (massive) pulmonary embolism with hemodynamic instability and evidence of right ventricular dysfunction and myocardial injury.\n\n- Recommendations:\n\n1. **Immediate Anticoagulation:**  \n   - Initiate unfractionated heparin (UFH) without delay, including a weight-adjusted bolus.  \n   - Suggested dosing: UFH bolus of 80 units/kg IV (approximately 6,640 units for 83 kg patient), followed by continuous infusion at 18 units/kg/hr (approximately 1,500 units/hr), adjusted according to activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) or anti-Xa levels.  \n   - Rationale: UFH is preferred in high-risk PE due to rapid onset and easy reversibility if bleeding occurs. (Class I, Level C)\n\n2. **Systemic Thrombolytic Therapy:**  \n   - Given the patient’s high-risk PE with hemodynamic instability and no absolute or relative contraindications to thrombolysis, systemic thrombolysis is strongly recommended.  \n   - Preferred regimen: Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA, alteplase) 100 mg IV over 2 hours.  \n   - Alternative accelerated regimen (if extreme instability or cardiac arrest occurs): 0.6 mg/kg over 15 minutes (max 50 mg), but standard 2-hour infusion is preferred here.  \n   - Rationale: Thrombolysis rapidly reduces pulmonary obstruction and RV afterload, improving hemodynamics and survival in high-risk PE. (Class I, Level B)  \n   - Precautions: Monitor closely for bleeding complications; ensure no contraindications are present (none identified in this patient).\n\n3. **Hemodynamic Support:**  \n   - Consider vasopressor support with norepinephrine to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP ≥ 65 mmHg) if hypotension persists despite volume resuscitation. Dobutamine may be added if there is evidence of RV failure with low cardiac output.  \n   - Rationale: Supports systemic perfusion during acute RV failure. (Class IIa, Level C)\n\n4. **Alternative Reperfusion Strategies:**  \n   - If thrombolysis is contraindicated or fails (persistent hemodynamic instability and RV dysfunction after 36 hours), consider:  \n     - Surgical pulmonary embolectomy (if surgical expertise and resources are available).  \n     - Percutaneous catheter-directed treatment (if available).  \n   - Rationale: These are recommended alternatives when thrombolysis is not feasible or unsuccessful. (Class I for surgery, Class IIa for catheter-directed therapy, Level C)\n\n5. **Monitoring and Further Diagnostics:**  \n   - Continuous hemodynamic and neurological monitoring in an intensive care setting.  \n   - Echocardiography should be performed urgently if available to assess RV function and guide management, although initial imaging shows RV dysfunction on CTPA.  \n   - Serial troponin and NT-proBNP measurements may help monitor response.  \n   - Monitor coagulation parameters and bleeding signs closely during thrombolysis and UFH therapy.\n\n6. **Post-Reperfusion Anticoagulation:**  \n   - After hemodynamic stabilization and completion of thrombolysis, continue anticoagulation with UFH transitioning to oral anticoagulation.  \n   - Given the high-risk status and exclusion from NOAC trials, transition timing should be individualized based on clinical stability.  \n   - If using NOACs, follow approved dosing regimens: e.g., apixaban 10 mg BID for 7 days then 5 mg BID, or rivaroxaban 15 mg BID for 21 days then 20 mg daily.  \n   - Duration of anticoagulation should be at least 3 months, adjusted per risk factors.\n\n- Summary:  \nThis patient has confirmed high-risk PE with hemodynamic instability and RV dysfunction, placing him at high risk of early mortality. Immediate initiation of weight-adjusted UFH anticoagulation combined with systemic thrombolytic therapy (rtPA 100 mg over 2 hours) is strongly recommended to rapidly restore pulmonary perfusion and improve hemodynamics. Hemodynamic support with vasopressors should be provided as needed. Close monitoring in an ICU setting is essential. If thrombolysis is contraindicated or fails, surgical embolectomy or catheter-directed therapy should be considered. After stabilization, transition to oral anticoagulation should be individualized. No absolute or relative contraindications to thrombolysis are present in this patient, supporting the safety of this approach. Prompt and aggressive management is critical to reduce mortality risk.",

                "content": "Thrombolytic therapy leads to faster improvements in pulmonary obstruction, PAP, and PVR in patients with PE, compared with UFH alone; these improvements are accompanied by a reduction in RV dilation on echocardiography. 276 - 279 The greatest benefit is observed when treatment is initiated within 48 h of symptom onset, but thrombolysis can still be useful in patients who have had symptoms for 6 - 14 days. 280 Unsuccessful thrombolysis, as judged by persistent clinical instability and unchanged RV dysfunction on echocardiography after 36 h, has been reported in 8% of high-risk PE patients. 281  \nA meta-analysis of thrombolysis trials that included (but were not confined to) patients with high-risk PE, defined mainly as the presence of cardiogenic shock, indicated a significant reduction in the combined outcome of mortality and recurrent PE (Supplementary Data Table 10 ). This was achieved with a 9.9% rate of severe bleeding and a 1.7% rate of intracranial haemorrhage. 282  \nIn normotensive patients with intermediate-risk PE, defined as the presence of RV dysfunction and elevated troponin levels, the impact of thrombolytic treatment was investigated in the Pulmonary Embolism Thrombolysis (PEITHO) trial. Thrombolytic therapy was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of haemodynamic decompensation or collapse, but this was paralleled by an increased risk of severe extracranial and intracranial bleeding. In the PEITHO trial, 30 day death rates were low in both treatment groups, although meta-analyses have suggested a reduction in PErelated and overall mortality of as much as 50 - 60% following thrombolytic treatment in the intermediate-risk category (Supplementary Data Table 10 ).  \nThe approved regimens and doses of thrombolytic agents for PE, as well as the contraindications to this type of treatment, are shown in Table 10 . Accelerated i.v. administration of recombinant tissuetype plasminogen activator (rtPA; 100 mg over 2 h) is preferable to prolonged infusions of first-generation thrombolytic agents (streptokinase and urokinase). Preliminary reports on the efficacy and safety of reduced-dose rtPA 284,285 need confirmation by solid evidence before any recommendations can be made in this regard. UFH may be administered during continuous infusion of alteplase, but should be discontinued during infusion of streptokinase or urokinase. 65 Reteplase, 286 desmoteplase, 287 or tenecteplase 179,278,279 have also been investigated; at present, none of these agents are approved for use in acute PE.  \nIt remains unclear whether early thrombolysis for (intermediateor high-risk) acute PE has an impact on clinical symptoms, functional limitation, or CTEPH at long-term follow-up. A small randomized trial of 83 patients suggested that thrombolysis might improve functional capacity at 3 months compared with anticoagulation alone. In the PEITHO trial, 179 mild persisting symptoms, mainly dyspnoea, were present in 33% of the patients at long-term (at 41.6 ± 15.7 months) clinical follow-up. However, the majority of patients (85% in the tenecteplase arm and 96% in the placebo arm) had a low or intermediate probability-based on the ESC Guidelines definition of persisting or new-onset PH at echocardiographic followup. Consequently, the findings of this study do not support a role for thrombolysis with the aim of preventing long-term sequelae ( section 10 ) after intermediate-risk PE, although they are limited by the fact that clinical follow-up was available for only 62% of the study population.",

        "content": "FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n- Patient State:  \nAn 87-year-old male patient with confirmed pulmonary embolism (PE) by CTPA. The patient is normotensive (SBP 156 mmHg), tachycardic (HR 116 bpm), with oxygen saturation of 89%. He has chronic cardiopulmonary disease including COPD. PESI score is 147 (Class V), and sPESI is 4 (high risk). Troponin and NT-proBNP are not elevated. Echocardiographic parameters assessing right ventricular (RV) dysfunction are not available. Creatinine clearance is 56 mL/min, indicating moderate renal impairment. The patient has an absolute contraindication to thrombolysis due to a recent unknown-origin ischemic stroke within the previous 6 months.\n\n- Diagnosis:  \nConfirmed acute pulmonary embolism without haemodynamic instability (normotensive, no hypoperfusion). The patient is classified as intermediate-high risk based on clinical severity scores (PESI Class V, sPESI 4), presence of chronic cardiopulmonary disease, and hypoxemia. RV dysfunction status is unknown due to unavailable echocardiographic data; however, given the high PESI and sPESI scores and hypoxemia, intermediate-high risk is the most appropriate classification pending further imaging.\n\n- Recommendations:\n\n1. **Hospitalization and Monitoring**  \n   - Admit the patient for close clinical monitoring given intermediate-high risk status and comorbidities (Class I, Level C).  \n   - Continuous monitoring of vital signs and oxygenation is essential to detect early signs of haemodynamic deterioration.\n\n2. **Further Diagnostic Evaluation**  \n   - Perform transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) urgently to assess for RV dysfunction (e.g., RV/LV ratio, TAPSE, McConnell sign) and right heart thrombi, as these parameters are prognostically relevant and will guide risk stratification and management (Class I, Level C).  \n   - Repeat cardiac biomarkers (troponin, NT-proBNP) if clinically indicated to monitor for dynamic changes.\n\n3. **Anticoagulation Therapy**  \n   - Initiate anticoagulation immediately without delay, as the patient has confirmed PE and no contraindications to anticoagulation (Class I, Level C).  \n   - Given the patient’s moderate renal impairment (CrCl 56 mL/min) and absence of severe renal dysfunction, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux is preferred over unfractionated heparin (UFH) for initial anticoagulation (Class I, Level A).  \n   - Dose LMWH according to weight and renal function; monitor renal function regularly.  \n   - Avoid NOACs initially until patient stability is confirmed and renal function is stable; NOACs can be considered later for long-term anticoagulation if renal function remains adequate and no other contraindications arise (Class I, Level A).  \n   - UFH may be reserved if rapid reversal is anticipated or if haemodynamic instability develops.\n\n4. **Avoid Thrombolytic Therapy**  \n   - Systemic thrombolysis is absolutely contraindicated due to recent unknown-origin ischemic stroke (Class III, Level C).  \n   - Routine primary reperfusion treatment is not recommended in intermediate-high risk PE without haemodynamic instability (Class III, Level B).  \n   - Rescue thrombolysis should only be considered if haemodynamic deterioration occurs and after careful risk-benefit assessment, but given absolute contraindication, alternative reperfusion strategies should be prioritized.\n\n5. **Alternative Reperfusion Options if Deterioration Occurs**  \n   - If the patient develops haemodynamic instability despite anticoagulation, consider surgical pulmonary embolectomy or percutaneous catheter-directed treatment, provided appropriate expertise and resources are available (Class IIa, Level C).  \n   - These options are preferred over thrombolysis in this patient due to absolute contraindications.\n\n6. **Supportive Care**  \n   - Provide supplemental oxygen to maintain adequate saturation.  \n   - Manage comorbid COPD and cardiopulmonary disease optimally.  \n   - Monitor for bleeding complications given advanced age and anticoagulation.\n\n7. **Transition to Oral Anticoagulation**  \n   - After clinical stabilization (typically after 2-3 days of parenteral anticoagulation), transition to oral anticoagulation can be considered.  \n   - If NOACs are chosen, follow recommended dosing regimens with initial higher doses of apixaban or rivaroxaban as per guidelines, adjusting for renal function (Class I, Level A).  \n   - Alternatively, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) can be used with appropriate overlap and INR monitoring.\n\n- Summary:  \nThis elderly patient with confirmed intermediate-high risk PE and absolute contraindication to thrombolysis requires immediate anticoagulation with LMWH or fondaparinux and hospitalization for close monitoring. Echocardiographic assessment of RV function is urgently needed to refine risk stratification. Systemic thrombolysis is contraindicated; therefore, reperfusion therapies such as surgical embolectomy or catheter-directed interventions should be reserved for haemodynamic deterioration. Careful supportive management and cautious transition to oral anticoagulation after stabilization are essential. Given the patient’s comorbidities and high risk scores, vigilant monitoring for early signs of decompensation is critical to optimize outcomes and avoid under-treatment.",

                "content": "For most cases of acute PE without haemodynamic compromise, parenteral or oral anticoagulation (without reperfusion techniques) is adequate treatment. As shown in Figure 6 , normotensive patients with at least one indicator of elevated PE-related risk, or with aggravating conditions or comorbidity, should be hospitalized. In this group, patients with signs of RV dysfunction on echocardiography or CTPA (graphically presented in Figure 3 ), accompanied by a positive troponin test, should be monitored over the first hours or days due to the risk of early haemodynamic decompensation and circulatory collapse. 179 Routine primary reperfusion treatment, notably full-dose systemic thrombolysis, is not recommended, as the risk of potentially life-threatening bleeding complications appears too high for the expected benefits from this treatment. 179 Rescue thrombolytic therapy or, alternatively, surgical embolectomy or percutaneous catheter-directed treatment should be reserved for patients who develop signs of haemodynamic instability. In the PEITHO trial, the mean time between randomization and death or haemodynamic decompensation was 1.79 ± 1.60 days in the placebo (heparin-only) arm. 179 Therefore, it appears reasonable to leave patients with intermediate-high-risk PE on LMWH anticoagulation over the first 2 - 3 days and ensure that they remain stable before switching to oral anticoagulation. As mentioned in the previous section, the specifications concerning the increased initial dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban, or the minimum overall period of heparin anticoagulation before switching to dabigatran or edoxaban, must be followed.  \nSuggestions for the anticoagulation and overall management of acute PE in specific clinical situations, for which conclusive evidence is lacking, are presented in Supplementary Data Table 9 .",

Based on pharmacokinetic data (Supplementary Data Table 6 ), 259 an equally rapid anticoagulant effect can also be achieved with a nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), and phase III clinical trials have demonstrated the non-inferior efficacy of a single-oral drug anticoagulation strategy using higher doses of apixaban for 7 days or rivaroxaban for 3 weeks. 259 - 261  \nLMWH and fondaparinux are preferred over UFH for initial anticoagulation in PE, as they carry a lower risk of inducing major bleeding and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. 262 - 265 Neither LMWH nor fondaparinux need routine monitoring of anti-Xa levels. Use of UFH is nowadays largely restricted to patients with overt haemodynamic instability or imminent haemodynamic decompensation in whom primary reperfusion treatment will be necessary. UFH is also recommended for patients with serious renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CrCl) < \\_30 mL/min] or severe obesity. If LMWH is prescribed in patients with CrCl 15 - 30 mL/min, an adapted dosing scheme should be used.

She is hemodynamically stable (SBP 108 mmHg, no hypoperfusion, no altered mental status), with intermediate-low early mortality risk (PESI class II, sPESI 0). Troponin is elevated, indicating myocardial injury. Renal function is severely impaired (CrCl 27 mL/min). Advanced liver disease is present as a relative contraindication for thrombolysis. Echocardiographic parameters of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction are not available.\n\n- Diagnosis:  \nConfirmed acute PE without hemodynamic instability. Intermediate-low risk category based on clinical scores and biomarker elevation but absence of documented RV dysfunction on imaging (not available). The patient requires hospitalization and close monitoring due to elevated troponin and comorbidities.\n\n- Recommendations:\n\n1. **Anticoagulation Initiation:**  \n   - Start anticoagulation immediately without delay (Class I, Level C).  \n   - Given severe renal impairment (CrCl 27 mL/min) and advanced liver disease, **unfractionated heparin (UFH)** is preferred over low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or NOACs for initial anticoagulation.  \n     - UFH dosing should be adjusted according to activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) monitoring to maintain therapeutic anticoagulation.  \n     - Rationale: LMWH requires dose adjustment and caution in CrCl 15-30 mL/min; NOACs are not recommended in CrCl <30 mL/min. Advanced liver disease may also affect metabolism and bleeding risk.  \n   - Avoid NOACs at this stage due to renal impairment and liver disease (Class III, Level C).\n\n2. **Monitoring and Hospitalization:**  \n   - Hospitalize the patient for close clinical and hemodynamic monitoring given intermediate-low risk with elevated troponin and comorbidities.  \n   - Monitor for signs of hemodynamic deterioration or RV dysfunction, especially within the first 48-72 hours.  \n   - If echocardiography is feasible, perform transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) to assess RV function and confirm risk stratification. This will guide further management.\n\n3. **Reperfusion Therapy:**  \n   - Routine primary systemic thrombolysis is **not recommended** in intermediate-low risk PE (Class III, Level B).  \n   - Given the absence of hemodynamic instability and presence of relative contraindications (advanced liver disease), thrombolysis is contraindicated at this stage.  \n   - Reserve rescue thrombolytic therapy, surgical embolectomy, or catheter-directed treatment only if the patient develops hemodynamic deterioration despite anticoagulation (Class I and IIa recommendations).\n\n4. **Transition to Long-Term Anticoagulation:**  \n   - After initial stabilization (2-3 days), consider transition to oral anticoagulation.  \n   - Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are preferred over NOACs due to renal impairment and liver disease.  \n   - Overlap UFH with VKA until INR is in therapeutic range (2.0-3.0), targeting an INR of approximately 2.5 (Class I, Level A).  \n   - Monitor liver function and coagulation parameters closely during VKA therapy.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**  \n   - Monitor renal function and liver function tests regularly.  \n   - Assess bleeding risk carefully given advanced liver disease.  \n   - Provide supportive care including oxygen supplementation as needed (oxygen saturation 94%, respiratory rate 35/min).  \n   - Consider infectious workup and management for fever (38.4ºC) as appropriate.\n\n- Summary:  \nThis patient has confirmed intermediate-low risk PE with elevated troponin and severe renal impairment plus advanced liver disease. Immediate anticoagulation with UFH is recommended due to renal and hepatic contraindications to LMWH and NOACs. Hospitalization and close monitoring are essential to detect early hemodynamic deterioration. Routine thrombolysis is contraindicated and should be reserved only for rescue therapy if instability develops. Transition to VKA after stabilization is advised, with careful monitoring of INR and liver function.

This is usually done with subcutaneous, weightadjusted low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux (Supplementary Data Table 5 ), or i.v. unfractionated heparin (UFH). Based on pharmacokinetic data (Supplementary Data Table 6 ), 259 an equally rapid anticoagulant effect can also be achieved with a nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), and phase III clinical trials have demonstrated the non-inferior efficacy of a single-oral drug anticoagulation strategy using higher doses of apixaban for 7 days or rivaroxaban for 3 weeks. 259 - 261  \nLMWH and fondaparinux are preferred over UFH for initial anticoagulation in PE, as they carry a lower risk of inducing major bleeding and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. 262 - 265 Neither LMWH nor fondaparinux need routine monitoring of anti-Xa levels. Use of UFH is nowadays largely restricted to patients with overt haemodynamic instability or imminent haemodynamic decompensation in whom primary reperfusion treatment will be necessary. UFH is also recommended for patients with serious renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CrCl) < \\_30 mL/min] or severe obesity. If LMWH is prescribed in patients with CrCl 15 - 30 mL/min, an adapted dosing scheme should be used. The  \ndosing of UFH is adjusted based on the activated partial thromboplastin time (Supplementary Data Table 7 ). 266",

        "content": "FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n- Patient State:  \nA 21-year-old female patient, weighing 81 kg and 157 cm tall, with no history of cancer, heart failure, COPD, or chronic cardiopulmonary disease. She is hemodynamically stable (SBP 139 mmHg, DBP 58 mmHg, no hypoperfusion), but presents with tachycardia (HR 152 bpm), mild fever (38.3ºC), and oxygen saturation of 95%. Echocardiography shows right ventricular (RV) dysfunction with RV/LV diameter ratio >1 and TAPSE 13 mm (below normal), indicating RV pressure overload. Troponin is elevated, while NT-proBNP is not elevated. Renal function is normal (CrCl 110 mL/min). PESI score is low (41, Class I), but sPESI is 1 (high), and early mortality risk is classified as intermediate-high. No absolute or relative contraindications to anticoagulation or thrombolysis are present.\n\n- Diagnosis:  \nSuspected pulmonary embolism without hemodynamic instability. The patient has intermediate-high risk features based on positive troponin and echocardiographic evidence of RV dysfunction, despite stable blood pressure and absence of shock. CTPA results are not available, and PE confirmation is pending.\n\n- Recommendations:\n\n1. **Diagnostic Workup:**\n\n   - **Urgently perform computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA)** to confirm or exclude pulmonary embolism.  \n     Rationale: The patient has intermediate-high risk features (RV dysfunction + elevated troponin) and clinical suspicion of PE. According to guidelines (Doc 1, Doc 2), CTPA is the imaging modality of choice in stable patients with suspected PE and intermediate-high risk to confirm diagnosis and assess clot burden.  \n     Note: If CTPA is not immediately available or feasible, consider bilateral lower limb venous compression ultrasonography to detect deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may support PE diagnosis and guide treatment.\n\n2. **Initial Management Pending Diagnosis:**\n\n   - **Initiate anticoagulation immediately without delay**, preferably with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux, given no contraindications.  \n     Suggested dosing:  \n     - Enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours (i.e., approximately 80 mg every 12 hours based on 81 kg weight).  \n     Rationale: Guidelines recommend starting anticoagulation in patients with intermediate or high clinical probability of PE while diagnostic workup is ongoing (Class I, Level C). LMWH is preferred over unfractionated heparin (UFH) in stable patients without contraindications (Class I, Level A).  \n     Monitor renal function and adjust dosing if needed, but current CrCl is normal.\n\n3. **Post-Diagnosis Management (if PE confirmed):**\n\n   - **Hospitalize the patient for close monitoring** due to intermediate-high risk status (positive troponin and RV dysfunction).  \n   - Continue therapeutic anticoagulation with LMWH for at least 2-3 days, monitoring for signs of hemodynamic deterioration.  \n   - After initial stabilization, consider switching to an oral anticoagulant (preferably a NOAC such as apixaban or rivaroxaban) following recommended dosing regimens:  \n     - Apixaban: 10 mg orally twice daily for 7 days, then 5 mg twice daily.  \n     - Rivaroxaban: 15 mg orally twice daily for 21 days, then 20 mg once daily.  \n     Rationale: NOACs are preferred over vitamin K antagonists in eligible patients (Class I, Level A). The patient has no contraindications to NOACs and normal renal function.  \n   - Routine primary systemic thrombolysis is **not recommended** in intermediate-high risk PE without hemodynamic instability due to bleeding risk (Class III, Level B).  \n   - **Reserve rescue thrombolytic therapy or surgical/percutaneous embolectomy** only if the patient develops hemodynamic instability or clinical deterioration during hospitalization (Class I, Level B for rescue thrombolysis).  \n   - Monitor vital signs, oxygenation, and repeat echocardiography as clinically indicated to detect early signs of decompensation.\n\n4. **Additional Considerations:**\n\n   - Given the elevated temperature (38.3ºC), evaluate for possible concomitant infection or alternative diagnoses.  \n   - Ensure adequate supportive care, including oxygen supplementation if saturation drops below 90%.  \n   - Educate patient and family about warning signs of clinical deterioration.\n\n- Summary:  \nThis young female patient with suspected intermediate-high risk PE (based on RV dysfunction and elevated troponin) is hemodynamically stable but at risk for early decompensation. Immediate anticoagulation with LMWH should be started without delay while urgently obtaining CTPA to confirm diagnosis. If PE is confirmed, hospitalization with close monitoring is mandatory, with continuation of anticoagulation and avoidance of routine thrombolysis unless clinical deterioration occurs. NOACs are preferred for long-term anticoagulation after initial stabilization. The absence of contraindications supports safe use of these therapies. Close clinical vigilance is essential given the risk of early hemodynamic compromise in intermediate-high risk PE patients.",

                "content": "For most cases of acute PE without haemodynamic compromise, parenteral or oral anticoagulation (without reperfusion techniques) is adequate treatment. As shown in Figure 6 , normotensive patients with at least one indicator of elevated PE-related risk, or with aggravating conditions or comorbidity, should be hospitalized. In this group, patients with signs of RV dysfunction on echocardiography or CTPA (graphically presented in Figure 3 ), accompanied by a positive troponin test, should be monitored over the first hours or days due to the risk of early haemodynamic decompensation and circulatory collapse. 179 Routine primary reperfusion treatment, notably full-dose systemic thrombolysis, is not recommended, as the risk of potentially life-threatening bleeding complications appears too high for the expected benefits from this treatment. 179 Rescue thrombolytic therapy or, alternatively, surgical embolectomy or percutaneous catheter-directed treatment should be reserved for patients who develop signs of haemodynamic instability. In the PEITHO trial, the mean time between randomization and death or haemodynamic decompensation was 1.79 ± 1.60 days in the placebo (heparin-only) arm. 179 Therefore, it appears reasonable to leave patients with intermediate-high-risk PE on LMWH anticoagulation over the first 2 - 3 days and ensure that they remain stable before switching to oral anticoagulation. As mentioned in the previous section, the specifications concerning the increased initial dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban, or the minimum overall period of heparin anticoagulation before switching to dabigatran or edoxaban, must be followed.  \nSuggestions for the anticoagulation and overall management of acute PE in specific clinical situations, for which conclusive evidence is lacking, are presented in Supplementary Data Table 9 .",

        "content": "FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n- Patient State:  \n31-year-old male patient with confirmed pulmonary embolism (PE) on CTPA. Hemodynamically stable (SBP 112 mmHg, no hypoperfusion), tachycardic (HR 110 bpm), mildly tachypneic (RR 23), febrile (38.0ºC), and mildly hypoxemic (O2 saturation 91%). PESI score 61 (Class I), but simplified PESI (sPESI) is 1 (high risk). No history of cancer, heart failure, COPD, or chronic cardiopulmonary disease. No absolute or relative contraindications to anticoagulation or thrombolysis. Echocardiographic parameters and cardiac biomarkers (troponin, NT-proBNP) are not available.\n\n- Diagnosis:  \nConfirmed acute pulmonary embolism without hemodynamic instability. Risk stratification places the patient in the intermediate-low risk category based on PESI I but sPESI ≥1 and absence of available RV dysfunction or biomarker data. Given missing echocardiographic and biomarker data, further risk stratification is incomplete.\n\n- Recommendations:\n\n1. **Immediate Anticoagulation:**  \n   - Initiate anticoagulation without delay (Class I, Level C).  \n   - Preferred initial anticoagulants are weight-adjusted low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux over unfractionated heparin (UFH), given the patient’s stable status and no renal impairment data suggesting otherwise (Class I, Level A).  \n   - Suggested LMWH dosing (e.g., enoxaparin): 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours (approximately 96 kg → 96 mg every 12 hours).  \n   - Alternatively, if oral anticoagulation is preferred and no contraindications exist, a NOAC such as apixaban or rivaroxaban can be considered after initial parenteral anticoagulation or as a single-drug approach per local protocols (Class I, Level A).  \n   - Monitor renal function to adjust dosing if needed.\n\n2. **Hospitalization and Monitoring:**  \n   - Given the intermediate-low risk classification (PESI I but sPESI 1), hospitalization is recommended for close monitoring (Class I, Level B).  \n   - The patient should be observed for early signs of hemodynamic deterioration, especially within the first 48-72 hours.\n\n3. **Further Risk Stratification with Imaging and Biomarkers:**  \n   - Perform transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) to assess for right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, including RV/LV diameter ratio, TAPSE, McConnell sign, and IVC diameter/collapsibility (Class IIa, Level B).  \n   - Obtain cardiac biomarkers: high-sensitivity troponin and NT-proBNP to evaluate myocardial injury and strain (Class IIa, Level B).  \n   - These tests are critical to refine risk stratification and guide management, as presence of RV dysfunction and elevated biomarkers would upgrade risk to intermediate-high, warranting closer monitoring and consideration of rescue reperfusion if deterioration occurs.\n\n4. **Avoid Routine Primary Thrombolysis:**  \n   - Routine systemic thrombolysis is not recommended in intermediate-low risk PE due to unfavorable risk-benefit ratio (Class III, Level B).  \n   - Thrombolytic therapy should be reserved for patients who develop hemodynamic instability or clinical deterioration despite anticoagulation (Class I, Level B).\n\n5. **Supportive Care:**  \n   - Provide supplemental oxygen to maintain saturation >92%.  \n   - Monitor vital signs frequently, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation.  \n   - Manage fever and other symptoms as appropriate.\n\n6. **Patient Education and Discharge Planning:**  \n   - Once stabilized and if no signs of deterioration, consider transition to oral anticoagulation with a NOAC or vitamin K antagonist per local protocols and patient factors.  \n   - Ensure patient has adequate social support and access to medical care before discharge.\n\n- Summary:  \nThis 31-year-old male with confirmed PE is hemodynamically stable but has an intermediate-low risk profile based on clinical scores and incomplete imaging/biomarker data. Immediate anticoagulation with LMWH or fondaparinux is indicated, along with hospitalization for monitoring. Echocardiography and cardiac biomarkers should be obtained promptly to refine risk stratification. Routine thrombolysis is contraindicated at this stage. Close observation is essential to detect early hemodynamic deterioration, at which point rescue reperfusion therapies should be considered. This approach aligns with current guideline recommendations prioritizing safety and evidence-based management.",

                "content": "For most cases of acute PE without haemodynamic compromise, parenteral or oral anticoagulation (without reperfusion techniques) is adequate treatment. As shown in Figure 6 , normotensive patients with at least one indicator of elevated PE-related risk, or with aggravating conditions or comorbidity, should be hospitalized. In this group, patients with signs of RV dysfunction on echocardiography or CTPA (graphically presented in Figure 3 ), accompanied by a positive troponin test, should be monitored over the first hours or days due to the risk of early haemodynamic decompensation and circulatory collapse. 179 Routine primary reperfusion treatment, notably full-dose systemic thrombolysis, is not recommended, as the risk of potentially life-threatening bleeding complications appears too high for the expected benefits from this treatment. 179 Rescue thrombolytic therapy or, alternatively, surgical embolectomy or percutaneous catheter-directed treatment should be reserved for patients who develop signs of haemodynamic instability. In the PEITHO trial, the mean time between randomization and death or haemodynamic decompensation was 1.79 ± 1.60 days in the placebo (heparin-only) arm. 179 Therefore, it appears reasonable to leave patients with intermediate-high-risk PE on LMWH anticoagulation over the first 2 - 3 days and ensure that they remain stable before switching to oral anticoagulation. As mentioned in the previous section, the specifications concerning the increased initial dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban, or the minimum overall period of heparin anticoagulation before switching to dabigatran or edoxaban, must be followed.  \nSuggestions for the anticoagulation and overall management of acute PE in specific clinical situations, for which conclusive evidence is lacking, are presented in Supplementary Data Table 9 .",

Based on pharmacokinetic data (Supplementary Data Table 6 ), 259 an equally rapid anticoagulant effect can also be achieved with a nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), and phase III clinical trials have demonstrated the non-inferior efficacy of a single-oral drug anticoagulation strategy using higher doses of apixaban for 7 days or rivaroxaban for 3 weeks. 259 - 261  \nLMWH and fondaparinux are preferred over UFH for initial anticoagulation in PE, as they carry a lower risk of inducing major bleeding and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. 262 - 265 Neither LMWH nor fondaparinux need routine monitoring of anti-Xa levels. Use of UFH is nowadays largely restricted to patients with overt haemodynamic instability or imminent haemodynamic decompensation in whom primary reperfusion treatment will be necessary. UFH is also recommended for patients with serious renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CrCl) < \\_30 mL/min] or severe obesity.

This is critical given the intermediate-high risk status and elevated biomarkers.  \n     *Rationale:* According to guidelines (Doc 1, Doc 6), CTPA is the gold standard for PE diagnosis in stable patients with intermediate or high clinical probability.\n\n   - **Perform transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)** to evaluate for RV dysfunction (e.g., RV dilation, RV/LV ratio >1.0, TAPSE <16 mm, McConnell sign). This will further refine risk stratification and guide management.  \n     *Rationale:* RV dysfunction is a key prognostic marker in intermediate-risk PE and influences treatment decisions (Doc 3, Doc 6).\n\n2. **Anticoagulation Treatment:**\n\n   - **Initiate anticoagulation immediately without delay**, even while awaiting imaging confirmation, given the high clinical suspicion and elevated biomarkers indicating myocardial injury.  \n     *Preferred agent:* Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux is recommended over unfractionated heparin (UFH) for initial parenteral anticoagulation.  \n     *Dosing example:* Enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours (approximately 58 kg → 58 mg BID).  \n     *Rationale:* Early anticoagulation reduces mortality and prevents clot propagation (Class I, Level C) (Doc 1).\n\n   - **Avoid NOACs initially** due to moderate renal impairment (CrCl 56 mL/min is borderline; caution advised especially with dabigatran and edoxaban). Transition to oral anticoagulation can be considered after stabilization and renal function reassessment.  \n     *Rationale:* NOACs are preferred in stable patients with normal renal function but require caution in CrCl <60 mL/min (Doc 1).\n\n3. **Reperfusion Therapy:**\n\n   - **Do not initiate systemic thrombolysis at this stage**, as the patient is haemodynamically stable without shock or hypotension, and routine thrombolysis is not recommended in intermediate-high risk PE (Class III, Level B) (Doc 1).  \n   \n   - **Monitor closely for signs of haemodynamic deterioration or clinical worsening.** If deterioration occurs, consider rescue thrombolytic therapy or alternative reperfusion strategies (surgical embolectomy or catheter-directed therapy), especially given the patient’s cancer and heart failure comorbidities.  \n     *Rationale:* Rescue thrombolysis is indicated only upon haemodynamic deterioration (Class I, Level B) (Doc 1).\n\n4. **Supportive Care and Monitoring:**\n\n   - Hospitalize the patient for close monitoring due to intermediate-high risk status and comorbidities.  \n   - Monitor vital signs, oxygenation, renal function, and cardiac biomarkers serially.  \n   - Assess for bleeding risk continuously, although no absolute or relative contraindications to anticoagulation or thrombolysis are currently present.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n\n   - Given the history of cancer, consider consultation with oncology and hematology for potential underlying prothrombotic states and long-term anticoagulation planning.  \n   - Evaluate for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with bilateral lower limb venous ultrasound as adjunctive diagnostic information.\n\n- Summary:  \nThis 39-year-old female patient with cancer and heart failure presents with suspected intermediate-high risk PE, evidenced by elevated troponin and NT-proBNP and high sPESI score, but without haemodynamic instability. Immediate initiation of parenteral anticoagulation with LMWH is strongly recommended while urgently obtaining CTPA and echocardiography to confirm PE and assess RV function. Systemic thrombolysis is not indicated at this stage but should be reserved for clinical deterioration. Hospitalization and close monitoring are essential due to the patient’s risk profile and comorbidities. Renal function and bleeding risk should be carefully monitored to guide anticoagulation management. This approach aligns with current evidence-based guidelines and prioritizes patient safety and optimal outcomes.",

        "content": "FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n- Patient State:  \nA 31-year-old male patient presenting with clinical and echocardiographic signs consistent with high-risk pulmonary embolism (PE). He exhibits persistent hypotension (SBP 74 mmHg), altered mental status (Glasgow 14), tachycardia (HR 141 bpm), and evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion. Echocardiography shows right ventricular (RV) dysfunction with RV/LV diameter ratio >1, McConnell sign positive, and no inspiratory collapsibility of a dilated IVC (3 cm). Laboratory tests reveal elevated troponin and NT-proBNP, indicating myocardial injury and RV strain. Creatinine clearance is preserved (93 mL/min). The patient has an absolute contraindication to systemic thrombolysis due to recent major trauma within the last 3 weeks. PESI score is 151 (Class V), and sPESI is 2 (high risk), confirming a high early mortality risk.\n\n- Diagnosis:  \nHigh-risk pulmonary embolism is strongly suspected based on clinical presentation, hemodynamic instability, RV dysfunction on echocardiography, and elevated cardiac biomarkers. Although CTPA is not available, the clinical and echocardiographic findings fulfill criteria for high-risk PE with obstructive shock. Given the hemodynamic instability and high-risk features, immediate management is warranted without delay.\n\n- Recommendations:\n\n1. **Immediate Anticoagulation:**  \n   - Initiate unfractionated heparin (UFH) without delay, including a weight-adjusted bolus.  \n   - Suggested dosing: UFH bolus 80 units/kg IV (approximately 6,480 units for 81 kg patient), followed by continuous infusion at 18 units/kg/hour (approximately 1,458 units/hour), adjusted according to activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) or anti-Xa levels.  \n   - Rationale: UFH is preferred in this setting due to rapid onset, short half-life, and reversibility, especially important given the contraindication to thrombolysis and potential need for urgent invasive procedures. (Class I, Level C)\n\n2. **Avoid Systemic Thrombolysis:**  \n   - Due to the absolute contraindication of recent major trauma (within 3 weeks), systemic thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated and must be avoided to prevent life-threatening bleeding. (Class I contraindication)\n\n3. **Consider Alternative Reperfusion Strategies:**  \n   - Evaluate the feasibility and availability of **surgical pulmonary embolectomy** as the first-line reperfusion option given thrombolysis contraindication.  \n   - If surgical expertise or resources are unavailable or the patient is not a surgical candidate, consider **percutaneous catheter-directed treatment** (e.g., catheter-directed thrombectomy or local low-dose thrombolysis) if available on-site.  \n   - These interventions should be performed urgently to relieve RV pressure overload and improve hemodynamics. (Surgical embolectomy: Class I, Level C; Catheter-directed treatment: Class IIa, Level C)\n\n4. **Hemodynamic Support:**  \n   - Initiate vasopressor support with norepinephrine to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP ≥ 65 mmHg).  \n   - Consider dobutamine if there is evidence of RV failure with low cardiac output after volume optimization.  \n   - Continuous monitoring in an intensive care setting is mandatory. (Class IIa, Level C)\n\n5. **Consider ECMO:**  \n   - If refractory circulatory collapse or cardiac arrest occurs, consider extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as a bridge to definitive reperfusion therapy (surgical or catheter-directed). This requires specialized center availability. (Class IIb, Level C)\n\n6. **Further Diagnostic Workup:**  \n   - Obtain urgent computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) if the patient’s hemodynamic status allows, to confirm diagnosis and assess clot burden and RV/LV ratio.  \n   - If CTPA is not feasible due to instability, rely on echocardiographic findings and clinical presentation for diagnosis and management decisions.  \n   - Monitor laboratory parameters including serial troponin, NT-proBNP, renal function, and coagulation profile.\n\n7. **Post-Stabilization Anticoagulation:**  \n   - After hemodynamic stabilization and reperfusion, continue anticoagulation with UFH transitioning to oral anticoagulation.  \n   - Given the high-risk status and exclusion from NOAC trials, the timing of transition to direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) or vitamin K antagonists should be individualized based on clinical judgment.  \n   - Follow approved dosing regimens for apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, or edoxaban as per guidelines once stable. (Refer to Supplementary Data Table 8 in guidelines)\n\n- Summary:  \nThis patient presents with confirmed high-risk PE characterized by hemodynamic instability, RV dysfunction, and elevated cardiac biomarkers. Systemic thrombolysis is absolutely contraindicated due to recent major trauma. Immediate initiation of weight-adjusted UFH anticoagulation is essential. Urgent referral for surgical pulmonary embolectomy or catheter-directed reperfusion therapy is strongly recommended, depending on local expertise and resources. Hemodynamic support with vasopressors and close ICU monitoring is critical. ECMO may be considered if refractory shock develops. Diagnostic confirmation with CTPA should be pursued if feasible. After stabilization, transition to oral anticoagulation should be carefully planned. This approach aligns with current guideline recommendations and prioritizes patient safety given the contraindications and clinical severity.",

Accordingly, clinical symptoms, and signs of overt RV failure and haemodynamic instability, indicate a high risk of early (in-hospital or 30 day) mortality. High-risk PE is defined by haemodynamic instability and encompasses the forms of clinical presentation shown in Table 4 .  \nAs an immediately life-threatening situation, high-risk PE requires an emergency diagnostic (upon suspicion) and therapeutic (upon confirmation or if the level of suspicion is sufficiently high) strategy, as outlined in section 7 . However, the absence of haemodynamic instability does not exclude beginning (and possibly progressing) RV dysfunction, and thus an elevated PE-related early risk. In this large population, further assessment (outlined in sections 5 and 7 ) is necessary to determine the level of risk and adjust management decisions accordingly.",

        "content": "FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n- Patient State:  \nA 60-year-old male patient presenting with clinical signs of haemodynamic instability consistent with high-risk pulmonary embolism (PE). Vital signs show persistent hypotension (SBP 82 mmHg, DBP 52 mmHg), tachycardia (132 bpm), tachypnea (28/min), hypoxia (O2 saturation 86%), and altered mental status (Glasgow Coma Scale 13). Echocardiography demonstrates right ventricular (RV) dysfunction with RV/LV diameter ratio >1, McConnell sign positive, and reduced TAPSE (9 mm), strongly supporting acute RV pressure overload. PESI score is 200 (Class V), and sPESI is 3 (high risk), indicating very high early mortality risk. No absolute contraindications to thrombolysis are present; however, there is a relative contraindication (recent transient ischemic attack within 6 months).\n\n- Diagnosis:  \nSuspected high-risk pulmonary embolism with haemodynamic instability and echocardiographic evidence of RV dysfunction. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is not available or feasible at this moment due to patient instability. The clinical and echocardiographic findings are sufficient to confirm the diagnosis of high-risk PE in this emergency context.\n\n- Recommendations:\n\n1. **Immediate Therapeutic Management:**\n\n   - **Anticoagulation:**  \n     Initiate unfractionated heparin (UFH) immediately with a weight-adjusted bolus followed by continuous infusion.  \n     - Suggested dosing:  \n       - Bolus: 80 units/kg IV (approx. 6800 units for 85 kg patient)  \n       - Continuous infusion: 18 units/kg/hr IV (approx. 1500 units/hr), adjusted to maintain activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 1.5–2.5 times control.  \n     - Rationale: UFH is preferred in unstable patients due to rapid onset and easy reversibility.\n\n2. **Reperfusion Therapy:**\n\n   - **Systemic thrombolysis** is the treatment of choice for high-risk PE (Class I, Level B).  \n     - However, the patient has a relative contraindication (recent TIA within 6 months).  \n     - Given the life-threatening haemodynamic instability and high mortality risk, systemic thrombolysis may still be considered after careful risk-benefit assessment by the treating physician.  \n     - If thrombolysis is deemed too risky or contraindicated, **surgical pulmonary embolectomy** or **percutaneous catheter-directed treatment** should be urgently considered as alternative reperfusion strategies (Class I and IIa, Level C respectively), provided that appropriate expertise and resources are available on-site.\n\n3. **Supportive Care:**\n\n   - Initiate vasopressor support with **norepinephrine** to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure and organ perfusion (Class IIa, Level C).  \n   - Consider inotropic support with **dobutamine** if RV failure leads to low cardiac output despite vasopressors.  \n   - Provide supplemental oxygen and consider advanced airway management if respiratory failure worsens.\n\n4. **Further Diagnostic Workup:**\n\n   - Once the patient is hemodynamically stabilized, perform **CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA)** to confirm the diagnosis and assess clot burden if feasible.  \n   - If CTPA remains unfeasible, consider **transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE)** or **bilateral lower limb venous compression ultrasonography (CUS)** to support diagnosis and guide therapy.  \n   - Obtain cardiac biomarkers (troponin, NT-proBNP) and renal function tests as soon as possible to assist risk stratification and guide anticoagulation dosing.\n\n5. **Monitoring and Follow-up:**\n\n   - Continuous hemodynamic and respiratory monitoring in an intensive care setting.  \n   - Reassess for bleeding complications, especially if thrombolysis is administered.  \n   - After reperfusion and stabilization, transition to oral anticoagulation following guideline-recommended regimens (e.g., apixaban or rivaroxaban with initial higher dosing or vitamin K antagonists after parenteral anticoagulation), tailored to patient’s renal function and bleeding risk.\n\n- Summary:  \nThis patient presents with clinically and echocardiographically confirmed high-risk PE with haemodynamic instability and RV dysfunction, placing him at very high risk of early mortality. Immediate initiation of UFH anticoagulation is mandatory. Systemic thrombolysis remains the first-line reperfusion therapy despite a relative contraindication (recent TIA), but alternative reperfusion options such as surgical embolectomy or catheter-directed therapy should be considered if thrombolysis is contraindicated or not feasible. Vasopressor and inotropic support are essential to maintain perfusion. Diagnostic confirmation with CTPA or ancillary imaging should be pursued once the patient is stabilized. Close monitoring for bleeding and hemodynamic status is critical. The urgency of intervention outweighs the relative contraindication to thrombolysis, but this decision requires careful clinical judgment and multidisciplinary discussion.",

As patients belonging to this risk category were excluded from the phase III NOAC trials, the optimal time point for this transition has not been determined by existing evidence but should instead be based on clinical judgement. The specifications concerning the higher initial dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban (for 1 and 3 weeks after PE diagnosis, respectively), or the minimum overall period (5 days) of heparin anticoagulation before switching to dabigatran or edoxaban, must be followed (see Supplementary Data Table 8 for tested and approved regimens).",

Accordingly, clinical symptoms, and signs of overt RV failure and haemodynamic instability, indicate a high risk of early (in-hospital or 30 day) mortality. High-risk PE is defined by haemodynamic instability and encompasses the forms of clinical presentation shown in Table 4 .  \nAs an immediately life-threatening situation, high-risk PE requires an emergency diagnostic (upon suspicion) and therapeutic (upon confirmation or if the level of suspicion is sufficiently high) strategy, as outlined in section 7 . However, the absence of haemodynamic instability does not exclude beginning (and possibly progressing) RV dysfunction, and thus an elevated PE-related early risk. In this large population, further assessment (outlined in sections 5 and 7 ) is necessary to determine the level of risk and adjust management decisions accordingly.",

        "content": "FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n- Patient State:  \nA 25-year-old male patient with confirmed pulmonary embolism (PE) by CTPA. The patient is hemodynamically stable (SBP 123 mmHg, HR 67 bpm, no hypoperfusion, normal mental status, oxygen saturation 98%). Clinical risk assessment shows low risk: PESI score 35 (Class I), sPESI 0 (low risk). No history of cancer, heart failure, COPD, or chronic cardiopulmonary disease. No absolute or relative contraindications to anticoagulation or thrombolysis. Echocardiographic parameters and cardiac biomarkers (troponin, NT-proBNP) are not available.\n\n- Diagnosis:  \nConfirmed acute pulmonary embolism, hemodynamically stable, low-risk profile based on clinical scores and absence of comorbidities or signs of severity.\n\n- Recommendations:  \n\n1. **Anticoagulation Treatment:**  \n   - Initiate anticoagulation promptly as the cornerstone of treatment for confirmed low-risk PE without hemodynamic compromise.  \n   - Preferred initial anticoagulants are low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux, given their favorable safety profile over unfractionated heparin (UFH) in stable patients without renal impairment.  \n   - Considering the patient’s age, weight (70 kg), and absence of renal impairment data, LMWH (e.g., enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours) is appropriate.  \n   - Alternatively, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as apixaban or rivaroxaban can be used as single-drug therapy:  \n     - Apixaban: 10 mg orally twice daily for 7 days, followed by 5 mg twice daily.  \n     - Rivaroxaban: 15 mg orally twice daily for 21 days, followed by 20 mg once daily.  \n   - Choice between LMWH and DOACs should consider patient preference, renal function (to be assessed), and potential drug interactions.  \n   - Routine monitoring of anti-Xa levels is not required for LMWH in this setting.\n\n2. **Hospitalization vs. Early Discharge:**  \n   - Given the low-risk classification (PESI I, sPESI 0), absence of RV dysfunction signs (though echocardiography not available), and no comorbidities or aggravating conditions, the patient is a candidate for early discharge with outpatient management if:  \n     - Adequate family or social support is available.  \n     - Easy access to medical care and follow-up is ensured.  \n     - No other reasons for hospitalization exist.  \n   - If these conditions are not met, short hospitalization for initiation and monitoring of anticoagulation is recommended.\n\n3. **Additional Diagnostic Testing:**  \n   - Echocardiography to assess right ventricular (RV) function is recommended to exclude subclinical RV dysfunction, which may upstage risk and influence management.  \n   - Cardiac biomarkers (troponin and NT-proBNP) should be measured to further stratify risk and detect myocardial injury.  \n   - Renal function tests (serum creatinine and creatinine clearance) should be obtained to guide anticoagulant choice and dosing adjustments if needed.\n\n4. **Avoidance of Thrombolysis:**  \n   - Routine systemic thrombolysis is not indicated in low-risk, hemodynamically stable patients due to the unfavorable risk-benefit ratio and absence of contraindications.  \n   - Thrombolytic therapy or invasive reperfusion should be reserved for patients who develop hemodynamic instability or clinical deterioration.\n\n5. **Follow-up and Monitoring:**  \n   - Close clinical follow-up is essential, especially during the first days of anticoagulation, to detect any signs of clinical worsening or bleeding complications.  \n   - Educate the patient about symptoms of PE progression or bleeding and ensure rapid access to emergency care if needed.\n\n- Summary:  \nThis 25-year-old male with confirmed low-risk PE and stable hemodynamics should receive prompt anticoagulation with LMWH or a DOAC as first-line therapy. Early discharge with outpatient management is appropriate if social support and access to care are adequate. Echocardiography and cardiac biomarkers should be obtained to exclude occult RV dysfunction and refine risk stratification. Routine thrombolysis is contraindicated in this low-risk setting. Close clinical monitoring and patient education are critical to ensure safety and timely detection of any deterioration.",

                "content": "For most cases of acute PE without haemodynamic compromise, parenteral or oral anticoagulation (without reperfusion techniques) is adequate treatment. As shown in Figure 6 , normotensive patients with at least one indicator of elevated PE-related risk, or with aggravating conditions or comorbidity, should be hospitalized. In this group, patients with signs of RV dysfunction on echocardiography or CTPA (graphically presented in Figure 3 ), accompanied by a positive troponin test, should be monitored over the first hours or days due to the risk of early haemodynamic decompensation and circulatory collapse. 179 Routine primary reperfusion treatment, notably full-dose systemic thrombolysis, is not recommended, as the risk of potentially life-threatening bleeding complications appears too high for the expected benefits from this treatment. 179 Rescue thrombolytic therapy or, alternatively, surgical embolectomy or percutaneous catheter-directed treatment should be reserved for patients who develop signs of haemodynamic instability. In the PEITHO trial, the mean time between randomization and death or haemodynamic decompensation was 1.79 ± 1.60 days in the placebo (heparin-only) arm. 179 Therefore, it appears reasonable to leave patients with intermediate-high-risk PE on LMWH anticoagulation over the first 2 - 3 days and ensure that they remain stable before switching to oral anticoagulation. As mentioned in the previous section, the specifications concerning the increased initial dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban, or the minimum overall period of heparin anticoagulation before switching to dabigatran or edoxaban, must be followed.  \nSuggestions for the anticoagulation and overall management of acute PE in specific clinical situations, for which conclusive evidence is lacking, are presented in Supplementary Data Table 9 .",

        "content": "FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n- Patient State:  \nA 35-year-old female patient with a history of cancer and chronic cardiopulmonary disease, currently normotensive (SBP 136 mmHg), no signs of hypoperfusion or altered mental status, and stable vital signs. Echocardiography shows right ventricular (RV) dysfunction (TAPSE 13 mm, below normal threshold <16 mm), indicating RV pressure overload. PESI score is 75 (Class II), but sPESI is 2, classifying her as high risk for early mortality (intermediate-high risk). There is a recent major surgery within the last 3 weeks, which constitutes an absolute contraindication to systemic thrombolysis. Relevant laboratory data (troponin, NT-proBNP, renal function) and CTPA imaging are not available.\n\n- Diagnosis:  \nSuspected pulmonary embolism without haemodynamic instability but with intermediate-high risk features due to RV dysfunction on echocardiography and high sPESI score. The diagnosis is not yet confirmed by CTPA or laboratory biomarkers. The patient is stable but at elevated risk of early decompensation.\n\n- Recommendations:\n\n1. **Diagnostic Workup:**\n\n   - **Urgent CTPA**: Given the high clinical probability of PE (high sPESI, RV dysfunction), perform computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) promptly to confirm or exclude PE. This is essential as the diagnosis is currently unconfirmed and will guide definitive management.  \n     - *Rationale*: Guidelines recommend CTPA as the first-line imaging in suspected PE with high clinical probability or RV dysfunction (Class I, Level C).  \n     - *Precaution*: Ensure renal function assessment prior to contrast administration; if unavailable, consider alternative imaging or hydration protocols.\n\n   - **Cardiac Biomarkers**: Obtain cardiac troponin and NT-proBNP levels as soon as possible to further stratify risk and confirm myocardial injury related to RV strain.  \n     - *Rationale*: Positive troponin in the presence of RV dysfunction confirms intermediate-high risk PE and guides monitoring intensity.\n\n   - **Venous Ultrasound**: Consider bilateral lower limb compression ultrasonography to detect deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may support the diagnosis if CTPA is delayed or contraindicated.\n\n2. **Initial Management:**\n\n   - **Anticoagulation**: Initiate anticoagulation immediately with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), e.g., enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours, unless contraindicated.  \n     - *Rationale*: Anticoagulation is the cornerstone of PE treatment in stable patients and should not be delayed while awaiting confirmatory tests if clinical suspicion is high (Class I, Level C).  \n     - *Precaution*: Monitor for bleeding risk, especially given recent major surgery; adjust dosing if renal impairment is identified.\n\n   - **Avoid systemic thrombolysis**: Due to the absolute contraindication of recent major surgery (within 3 weeks), systemic thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated.  \n     - *Rationale*: High bleeding risk outweighs benefits in intermediate-high risk PE without haemodynamic instability.\n\n3. **Monitoring and Supportive Care:**\n\n   - Admit the patient to a monitored setting (intermediate care or step-down unit) for close observation over the first 48-72 hours due to intermediate-high risk status and potential for haemodynamic deterioration.  \n     - *Rationale*: Guidelines recommend hospitalization and monitoring for patients with RV dysfunction and positive troponin or high-risk scores to detect early signs of decompensation.\n\n   - Monitor vital signs, oxygen saturation, and clinical status frequently. Provide supplemental oxygen if saturation falls below 90%.\n\n4. **Escalation Plan if Clinical Deterioration Occurs:**\n\n   - If the patient develops haemodynamic instability (persistent hypotension, shock, cardiac arrest), consider rescue reperfusion therapy. Given thrombolysis contraindication, evaluate for:  \n     - **Surgical pulmonary embolectomy** or  \n     - **Percutaneous catheter-directed therapies** (e.g., catheter-directed thrombolysis or thrombectomy), if available and expertise exists onsite.  \n     - *Rationale*: These are recommended alternatives for high-risk PE patients with contraindications to thrombolysis (Class I and IIa, Level C).\n\n   - Consider hemodynamic support with vasopressors (norepinephrine, dobutamine) if shock develops.\n\n5. **Transition to Oral Anticoagulation:**\n\n   - After clinical stabilization and at least 2-3 days of parenteral anticoagulation, transition to oral anticoagulants can be considered.  \n   - Use direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as apixaban or rivaroxaban following approved dosing regimens:  \n     - Apixaban: 10 mg twice daily for 7 days, then 5 mg twice daily.  \n     - Rivaroxaban: 15 mg twice daily for 21 days, then 20 mg once daily.  \n   - Alternatively, if switching to dabigatran or edoxaban, ensure a minimum of 5 days of parenteral anticoagulation before transition.  \n   - *Rationale*: DOACs are effective and safe for PE treatment; however, initial parenteral anticoagulation is required in intermediate-high risk patients.\n\n- Summary:  \nThis patient presents with suspected intermediate-high risk PE characterized by RV dysfunction and high sPESI score but is haemodynamically stable. Immediate initiation of anticoagulation with LMWH is warranted while urgently confirming diagnosis with CTPA and cardiac biomarkers. Systemic thrombolysis is contraindicated due to recent major surgery; therefore, close monitoring in hospital is essential to detect early deterioration. Rescue reperfusion options such as surgical embolectomy or catheter-directed therapies should be considered if haemodynamic instability develops. Transition to oral anticoagulation should follow stabilization, adhering to recommended dosing protocols. This approach balances the risk of bleeding with the need for effective PE management and aligns with current guideline recommendations.",

                "content": "For most cases of acute PE without haemodynamic compromise, parenteral or oral anticoagulation (without reperfusion techniques) is adequate treatment. As shown in Figure 6 , normotensive patients with at least one indicator of elevated PE-related risk, or with aggravating conditions or comorbidity, should be hospitalized. In this group, patients with signs of RV dysfunction on echocardiography or CTPA (graphically presented in Figure 3 ), accompanied by a positive troponin test, should be monitored over the first hours or days due to the risk of early haemodynamic decompensation and circulatory collapse. 179 Routine primary reperfusion treatment, notably full-dose systemic thrombolysis, is not recommended, as the risk of potentially life-threatening bleeding complications appears too high for the expected benefits from this treatment. 179 Rescue thrombolytic therapy or, alternatively, surgical embolectomy or percutaneous catheter-directed treatment should be reserved for patients who develop signs of haemodynamic instability. In the PEITHO trial, the mean time between randomization and death or haemodynamic decompensation was 1.79 ± 1.60 days in the placebo (heparin-only) arm. 179 Therefore, it appears reasonable to leave patients with intermediate-high-risk PE on LMWH anticoagulation over the first 2 - 3 days and ensure that they remain stable before switching to oral anticoagulation. As mentioned in the previous section, the specifications concerning the increased initial dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban, or the minimum overall period of heparin anticoagulation before switching to dabigatran or edoxaban, must be followed.  \nSuggestions for the anticoagulation and overall management of acute PE in specific clinical situations, for which conclusive evidence is lacking, are presented in Supplementary Data Table 9 .",

Accordingly, clinical symptoms, and signs of overt RV failure and haemodynamic instability, indicate a high risk of early (in-hospital or 30 day) mortality. High-risk PE is defined by haemodynamic instability and encompasses the forms of clinical presentation shown in Table 4 .  \nAs an immediately life-threatening situation, high-risk PE requires an emergency diagnostic (upon suspicion) and therapeutic (upon confirmation or if the level of suspicion is sufficiently high) strategy, as outlined in section 7 . However, the absence of haemodynamic instability does not exclude beginning (and possibly progressing) RV dysfunction, and thus an elevated PE-related early risk. In this large population, further assessment (outlined in sections 5 and 7 ) is necessary to determine the level of risk and adjust management decisions accordingly.",

This is critical to guide risk stratification and management.  \n     *Rationale:* Guidelines recommend CTPA as the first-line imaging in stable patients with intermediate or high clinical probability of PE.  \n     *Note:* If CTPA is contraindicated or unavailable, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) should be performed promptly to evaluate RV dysfunction and exclude alternative diagnoses.\n\n   - **Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE)**: If CTPA is delayed or contraindicated, perform TTE to assess RV function (e.g., RV/LV ratio, TAPSE, McConnell sign) and presence of right heart thrombi. This will help refine risk stratification and urgency of treatment.\n\n   - **Laboratory tests**: Repeat troponin and consider NT-proBNP measurement if not yet done, to further assess myocardial strain and risk.\n\n2. **Treatment:**\n\n   - **Anticoagulation:**  \n     Initiate therapeutic anticoagulation immediately upon suspicion of PE, unless contraindicated. Given the patient’s moderate renal impairment (CrCl 46 mL/min), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is preferred initially, with dose adjustment as per renal function (e.g., enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneously once daily or 1 mg/kg twice daily with monitoring). Alternatively, unfractionated heparin (UFH) can be used if rapid reversal is anticipated or if renal function worsens.  \n     *Rationale:* Guidelines recommend anticoagulation as the cornerstone of treatment in all confirmed or strongly suspected PE without contraindications.\n\n   - **Hospitalization and Monitoring:**  \n     Hospitalize the patient for close monitoring due to intermediate-high risk status (PESI III, elevated troponin) and risk of early hemodynamic deterioration. Monitor vital signs, oxygenation, and clinical status closely for at least 48-72 hours.\n\n   - **Reperfusion Therapy:**  \n     Routine systemic thrombolysis is **not recommended** in intermediate-high risk PE due to bleeding risk, especially considering the patient’s relative contraindication (chronic oral anticoagulation).  \n     *Rescue thrombolysis* or alternative reperfusion (surgical embolectomy or catheter-directed therapy) should be reserved for patients who develop hemodynamic instability or clinical deterioration during monitoring.\n\n3. **Additional Considerations:**\n\n   - Review and adjust current oral anticoagulation therapy as appropriate once diagnosis is confirmed and patient stabilized. Transition to oral anticoagulants (e.g., apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, or edoxaban) should follow guideline-recommended dosing and timing, considering renal function and initial parenteral anticoagulation duration.\n\n   - Assess for potential bleeding risks continuously, given the patient’s anticoagulation status and renal impairment.\n\n- Summary:  \nThis 67-year-old female patient with suspected intermediate-high risk PE and elevated troponin requires urgent diagnostic confirmation with CTPA and/or echocardiography to assess clot burden and RV function. Immediate therapeutic anticoagulation with LMWH or UFH should be started without delay. Hospitalization and close monitoring are essential due to the risk of early hemodynamic decompensation. Systemic thrombolysis is contraindicated at this stage given relative contraindications and absence of hemodynamic instability; reperfusion therapy should be reserved for clinical deterioration. Renal function and bleeding risk must be carefully considered in anticoagulation management. Prompt imaging and clinical reassessment will guide further therapeutic decisions.",

                "content": "For most cases of acute PE without haemodynamic compromise, parenteral or oral anticoagulation (without reperfusion techniques) is adequate treatment. As shown in Figure 6 , normotensive patients with at least one indicator of elevated PE-related risk, or with aggravating conditions or comorbidity, should be hospitalized. In this group, patients with signs of RV dysfunction on echocardiography or CTPA (graphically presented in Figure 3 ), accompanied by a positive troponin test, should be monitored over the first hours or days due to the risk of early haemodynamic decompensation and circulatory collapse. 179 Routine primary reperfusion treatment, notably full-dose systemic thrombolysis, is not recommended, as the risk of potentially life-threatening bleeding complications appears too high for the expected benefits from this treatment. 179 Rescue thrombolytic therapy or, alternatively, surgical embolectomy or percutaneous catheter-directed treatment should be reserved for patients who develop signs of haemodynamic instability. In the PEITHO trial, the mean time between randomization and death or haemodynamic decompensation was 1.79 ± 1.60 days in the placebo (heparin-only) arm. 179 Therefore, it appears reasonable to leave patients with intermediate-high-risk PE on LMWH anticoagulation over the first 2 - 3 days and ensure that they remain stable before switching to oral anticoagulation. As mentioned in the previous section, the specifications concerning the increased initial dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban, or the minimum overall period of heparin anticoagulation before switching to dabigatran or edoxaban, must be followed.  \nSuggestions for the anticoagulation and overall management of acute PE in specific clinical situations, for which conclusive evidence is lacking, are presented in Supplementary Data Table 9 .",

        "content": "FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n- Patient State:  \n56-year-old male patient with confirmed pulmonary embolism (PE) on CTPA. The patient is hemodynamically stable (SBP 108 mmHg, no hypoperfusion, no altered mental status), but has intermediate-low early mortality risk (PESI Class III, sPESI = 1). Troponin is elevated, indicating myocardial injury, but echocardiographic parameters of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction are not available. Renal function is moderately impaired with creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 24 mL/min. No absolute or relative contraindications to anticoagulation or thrombolysis are present.\n\n- Diagnosis:  \nConfirmed intermediate-risk PE with elevated troponin and stable hemodynamics. RV dysfunction status is unknown due to unavailable echocardiographic data. The patient’s risk profile corresponds to intermediate-high risk if RV dysfunction is present, or intermediate-low risk if absent. Given the elevated troponin and intermediate PESI, close monitoring is warranted.\n\n- Recommendations:\n\n1. **Further Diagnostic Evaluation:**\n   - Perform transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) urgently to assess for RV dysfunction (e.g., RV/LV diameter ratio, TAPSE, McConnell sign, IVC diameter and collapsibility). This is critical to refine risk stratification and guide management.  \n   - Continuous clinical and hemodynamic monitoring during the first 48-72 hours is essential to detect early signs of hemodynamic deterioration.\n\n2. **Anticoagulation Therapy:**\n   - Initiate anticoagulation immediately if not already started.  \n   - Given the patient’s moderate renal impairment (CrCl 24 mL/min), **unfractionated heparin (UFH)** is preferred over low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux due to better controllability and safety in renal dysfunction (Class I, Level A).  \n   - UFH dosing should be adjusted according to activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) to maintain therapeutic anticoagulation.  \n   - Avoid direct oral anticoagulants (NOACs) initially, as their use is not recommended in patients with CrCl <30 mL/min.  \n   - After stabilization and improvement in renal function (if possible), transition to oral anticoagulation can be considered, preferably with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) overlapping with parenteral anticoagulation until INR is therapeutic (2.0-3.0).\n\n3. **Reperfusion Therapy:**\n   - Routine systemic thrombolysis is **not recommended** in this intermediate-risk, hemodynamically stable patient due to the high bleeding risk and lack of clear mortality benefit (Class III, Level B).  \n   - Reserve rescue thrombolytic therapy, surgical embolectomy, or catheter-directed reperfusion for patients who develop hemodynamic instability or clinical deterioration despite anticoagulation (Class I, Level B for rescue thrombolysis).  \n   - Given no absolute or relative contraindications to thrombolysis currently, these options remain available if clinical status worsens.\n\n4. **Supportive Care and Monitoring:**\n   - Hospitalize the patient for close observation given intermediate risk and elevated troponin.  \n   - Monitor oxygen saturation and provide supplemental oxygen as needed to maintain saturation >90%.  \n   - Monitor renal function and adjust anticoagulation accordingly.  \n   - Monitor for bleeding complications given anticoagulation and renal impairment.\n\n- Summary:  \nThis 56-year-old male with confirmed intermediate-risk PE and elevated troponin but stable hemodynamics requires immediate anticoagulation with UFH due to moderate renal impairment (CrCl 24 mL/min). Echocardiographic assessment of RV function is urgently needed to refine risk stratification. Routine systemic thrombolysis is contraindicated at this stage; reperfusion therapies should be reserved for clinical deterioration. Hospitalization with close monitoring for early signs of hemodynamic compromise is mandatory. Transition to oral anticoagulation (preferably VKA) can be considered once stable and renal function permits. This approach balances efficacy and safety, minimizing bleeding risk while addressing the patient’s elevated risk profile.",

        "content": "FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n- Patient State:  \nA 63-year-old female patient, weighing 78 kg and 159 cm tall, presenting with clinical signs of haemodynamic instability consistent with high-risk pulmonary embolism (PE). Vital signs show persistent hypotension (SBP 89 mmHg, DBP 46 mmHg), tachycardia (HR 109 bpm), hypoperfusion (cold, clammy skin), and mild hypoxemia (SpO2 93%). No absolute contraindications to thrombolysis are present; however, there is a relative contraindication due to active infective endocarditis. Echocardiographic and CTPA data are not available. Laboratory markers including troponin and NT-proBNP are not available. The patient’s PESI score is 113 (Class IV), and sPESI is 1 (high risk), indicating a high early mortality risk.\n\n- Diagnosis:  \nSuspected high-risk pulmonary embolism with haemodynamic instability (persistent hypotension and signs of end-organ hypoperfusion). The diagnosis is currently unconfirmed by imaging or laboratory markers due to unavailable data. Given the clinical presentation and high-risk scores, immediate diagnostic and therapeutic actions are warranted.\n\n- Recommendations:\n\n1. **Immediate Diagnostic Workup:**\n\n   - **Bedside Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE):**  \n     Urgently perform bedside TTE to assess for right ventricular (RV) dysfunction (e.g., RV dilation, RV/LV ratio >1.0, McConnell sign, TAPSE <16 mm). This is critical to support the diagnosis of high-risk PE in the setting of haemodynamic instability and to guide urgent management.  \n     *Rationale:* Echocardiographic evidence of RV dysfunction in unstable patients is sufficient to initiate reperfusion therapy without waiting for CTPA (Class I, Level C).\n\n   - **Bilateral Venous Compression Ultrasonography (CUS):**  \n     If feasible, perform bilateral lower limb venous CUS to detect proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may support the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and PE.\n\n   - **CT Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA):**  \n     If the patient stabilizes or if bedside imaging is inconclusive and the patient’s condition allows, perform CTPA to confirm the diagnosis and assess clot burden and RV/LV ratio. However, do not delay treatment if the patient remains unstable.\n\n   - **Laboratory Tests:**  \n     Obtain cardiac biomarkers (troponin, NT-proBNP) and renal function tests as soon as possible to assist risk stratification and guide anticoagulation dosing.\n\n2. **Therapeutic Management:**\n\n   - **Anticoagulation:**  \n     Initiate anticoagulation immediately with intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) including a weight-adjusted bolus (e.g., 80 units/kg bolus followed by continuous infusion at 18 units/kg/hr, adjusted per activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT]). UFH is preferred due to its short half-life and reversibility, especially in unstable patients.  \n     *Class I, Level C recommendation.*\n\n   - **Reperfusion Therapy:**\n\n     - **Systemic Thrombolysis:**  \n       Although systemic thrombolysis is the treatment of choice for high-risk PE (Class I, Level B), the presence of active infective endocarditis constitutes a relative contraindication. Given the high mortality risk from untreated high-risk PE, thrombolysis may still be considered after careful multidisciplinary risk-benefit assessment. However, caution is warranted due to increased bleeding and embolic risks.\n\n     - **Alternative Reperfusion Strategies:**  \n       Given the relative contraindication to thrombolysis, **surgical pulmonary embolectomy** is strongly recommended if expertise and resources are available (Class I, Level C).  \n       If surgical embolectomy is not feasible or delayed, **percutaneous catheter-directed treatment** (e.g., catheter-directed thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy) should be considered (Class IIa, Level C).  \n       These options provide reperfusion with potentially lower bleeding risk compared to systemic thrombolysis.\n\n   - **Hemodynamic Support:**  \n     Initiate vasopressor support with norepinephrine to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (target MAP ≥ 65 mmHg). Dobutamine may be added if there is evidence of RV failure with low cardiac output (Class IIa, Level C).  \n     Monitor closely for signs of circulatory collapse.\n\n   - **Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO):**  \n     Consider ECMO as a bridge to reperfusion therapy in cases of refractory circulatory collapse or cardiac arrest, if available (Class IIb, Level C).\n\n3. **Monitoring and Follow-up:**\n\n   - Continuous hemodynamic and oxygenation monitoring in an intensive care setting.  \n   - Repeat echocardiography after initial stabilization to assess RV function and response to therapy.  \n   - After reperfusion and stabilization, transition to long-term anticoagulation with oral agents (e.g., apixaban or rivaroxaban) following guideline-recommended dosing regimens and minimum parenteral anticoagulation periods.\n\n- Summary:  \nThis patient presents with suspected high-risk PE characterized by haemodynamic instability and high early mortality risk. Immediate bedside echocardiography is essential to confirm RV dysfunction and support the diagnosis. Anticoagulation with UFH should be started without delay. Due to the relative contraindication of active infective endocarditis, systemic thrombolysis carries increased risk and should be carefully weighed; alternative reperfusion strategies such as surgical embolectomy or catheter-directed therapy are preferred if available. Hemodynamic support with vasopressors is critical. Close monitoring in an ICU setting is mandatory. Prompt multidisciplinary evaluation is essential to optimize reperfusion strategy and minimize bleeding and embolic complications.",

                "content": "For most cases of acute PE without haemodynamic compromise, parenteral or oral anticoagulation (without reperfusion techniques) is adequate treatment. As shown in Figure 6 , normotensive patients with at least one indicator of elevated PE-related risk, or with aggravating conditions or comorbidity, should be hospitalized. In this group, patients with signs of RV dysfunction on echocardiography or CTPA (graphically presented in Figure 3 ), accompanied by a positive troponin test, should be monitored over the first hours or days due to the risk of early haemodynamic decompensation and circulatory collapse. 179 Routine primary reperfusion treatment, notably full-dose systemic thrombolysis, is not recommended, as the risk of potentially life-threatening bleeding complications appears too high for the expected benefits from this treatment. 179 Rescue thrombolytic therapy or, alternatively, surgical embolectomy or percutaneous catheter-directed treatment should be reserved for patients who develop signs of haemodynamic instability. In the PEITHO trial, the mean time between randomization and death or haemodynamic decompensation was 1.79 ± 1.60 days in the placebo (heparin-only) arm. 179 Therefore, it appears reasonable to leave patients with intermediate-high-risk PE on LMWH anticoagulation over the first 2 - 3 days and ensure that they remain stable before switching to oral anticoagulation. As mentioned in the previous section, the specifications concerning the increased initial dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban, or the minimum overall period of heparin anticoagulation before switching to dabigatran or edoxaban, must be followed.  \nSuggestions for the anticoagulation and overall management of acute PE in specific clinical situations, for which conclusive evidence is lacking, are presented in Supplementary Data Table 9 .",

Accordingly, clinical symptoms, and signs of overt RV failure and haemodynamic instability, indicate a high risk of early (in-hospital or 30 day) mortality. High-risk PE is defined by haemodynamic instability and encompasses the forms of clinical presentation shown in Table 4 .  \nAs an immediately life-threatening situation, high-risk PE requires an emergency diagnostic (upon suspicion) and therapeutic (upon confirmation or if the level of suspicion is sufficiently high) strategy, as outlined in section 7 . However, the absence of haemodynamic instability does not exclude beginning (and possibly progressing) RV dysfunction, and thus an elevated PE-related early risk. In this large population, further assessment (outlined in sections 5 and 7 ) is necessary to determine the level of risk and adjust management decisions accordingly.",
